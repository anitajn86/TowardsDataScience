 History [ ] 
 In exchange for Amara's ""generous"" donations to the Academy, several Council members helped ensure that her trading business was extended certain leniencies at the borders. Thus, she was one of several people affected when the newly appointed  Councilor   Jayce Talis , in his desire to ensure the safety and protection of the Hexgates and prevent corruption from affecting this, ordered the  enforcers  to more strictly inspect all merchandise that went through the gates.
 For this, Amara conferred with Council  Bolbok  about their possible action or other possible arrangements. With a target now on Jayce's back and several powerful enemies,  Councilor Medarda  advised Jayce to stand down and make his own deals with them. Jayce agreed and, when Amara showed reluctance, told her that she would be investing in his Hextech research and thus access to new developments as they became available. Amara eagerly accepted.

 Biography [ ] 
 History [ ] 
 
 I will give you the world, child,  if  you prove you can take it.
 
 Ambessa to  Mel , "" The Monster You Created "" 
 When she was ten, her father brought her to the aftermath of the Battle of Hildenard to collect weapons from the fallen in exchange for a gold coin each, exposing her to death at the tender age.
 She tried to imbue the same principles in her two known children, particularly in her daughter  Mel , whom Ambessa tried to mold into a warrior and leader willing to do whatever is necessary to ensure their survival from a young age. This seemingly proved futile, however, as her son  Kino  preferred diplomacy over war, and Mel adapted his way of thinking and came to see war and killing only as a last resort.
 
 
 Because  you  weakened me! I couldn't endure the look in your eyes whenever I made the decisions—the necessary decisions to keep us safe!
 
 Ambessa on why she sent  her own daughter  away, "" The Monster You Created "" 
 Eventually, she sent Mel away from their home to  Piltover , pointing out that her sentimentality would work well among the ""soft-spined idealists"", and would later use the excuse that it was for her to oversee their family's interests in the city. [2]  In truth, she sent her away because she could no longer bear Mel's disapproval of her decisions. [3] 
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Mel eventually came to power in Piltover as a  Councilor  and the wealthiest person in the city, [4]  and she would later sponsor the research of  Jayce Talis  into  Hextech  that then revolutionized trade and travel in the world, thus having a hand in Piltover's undeniable progress. [5] 
 Apparently too distracted to have been able to do anything at the time, her son Kino was killed by a man who earned his ire. [2]  Ambessa realized that the man was not done with his grudge and would strike again and could have enough resources to potentially overpower them. [3]  To aid their victory in a potential war, Ambessa visited Piltover in hopes of getting her hands on weaponized Hextech.
 Having heard news of the city's ongoing conflict with  Zaun , she tried to convince both Mel and Jayce to finally engage the undercity in war and use his Hextech weapons for it. Mel determinedly refused and convinced the Council to avoid any war-inciting actions as well, but Jayce was swayed enough to attack one of  Silco 's  Shimmer  factories with  Vi . When Jayce accidentally killed  a boy , [2]  however, Jayce completely changed his mind.
 Mel confronted her about her manipulation of Jayce, and she finally told Mel about the impending conflict at Noxus. She then asked Mel to let the war happen, after which she would be welcome back home and at her side. Mel would ultimately turn down the offer, taking off her family ring as she agreed to Jayce's proposal of peace with Zaun by granting them their requested independence. [3] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Ambessa is a woman of unshakable confidence, displaying no vulnerability or emotional weakness. Raised in Noxus, where strength is paramount, she embraces aggression over passivity, reflecting the harsh upbringing her father instilled in her and the ruthless Noxian culture. Her cold, merciless nature toward enemies is tempered by a hedonistic enjoyment of Piltover's luxuries and the exotic foods of foreign lands, a reflection of her appreciation for power and indulgence. A master of both eloquent speech and brutal force, she deftly manipulates situations and people to serve her and her family’s interests, whether through words or actions.
 Although she values violence as a means to secure her position, Ambessa isn’t entirely dismissive of diplomacy. Her decision not to exile Kino—despite his purely diplomatic approach—suggests that while aggression is favored, she recognizes the tactical value of negotiation when it suits her. However, she is selective with her violence, always considering the long-term impact of her actions. Ready to eliminate threats if necessary, she believes that killing one person can sometimes prevent a larger, more destructive conflict down the line. Above all, Ambessa is a survivor, willing to take any action to protect her family and their legacy.
 Ambessa respects aggression in all its forms—be it in warfare or diplomatic dealings—but she equally values cunning, provided it doesn’t undermine the display of power. Her advice to her daughter, Mel, about embodying ""both the fox and the wolf"" underscores this duality: while one can favor one trait over the other, true success in her family demands mastery of both. The greatest offense in her eyes is not a lack of cunning or aggression, but the display of weakness or incompetence, which she sees as unforgivable.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Ambessa is a strong, muscular woman with rich brown skin and light brown eyes. Her coily hair, ranging from grey to black, is styled loosely above her shoulders, complementing her fierce, warrior-like appearance. She wears regal Noxian attire befitting her high rank, primarily in black and red, with metallic silver accents. A red cloak with black fur drapes over her shoulder, further enhancing her commanding presence. Her face and upper body are marked with numerous battle scars, a testament to her hardened life as a warlord and her willingness to engage in direct combat.
 In Season 2 Ambessa has her hair braided back into 3 braids capped in gold. She wears her battle attire which consists of tan and black garb with accents of gold and red threads, and red cloth wrapped around her arms and golden triangular earrings. In Act 1, she wears a regal headpiece that she wraps her braids with, and a militaristic black jacket with large golden shoulder pieces and accents. Ambessa has dark brown lipstick with a golden stripe on her bottom lip, and red stripes painted under her eyes. In battle, Ambessa wears a golden feline-like mask.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Skilled Melee Combatant : Ambessa Medarda is a formidable melee fighter, known for her proficiency with a weapon resembling a katar. Her remarkable reflexes and agility are evident in her ability to swiftly and decisively eliminate opponents, including executing a clean decapitation with a single strike. Her combat style reflects the precision and efficiency instilled in her by years of training and battle experience.
 Manipulative Strategist : Ambessa excels in manipulation and psychological warfare, using her keen understanding of others’ emotions to further her objectives. One notable example is her ability to persuade Chem-Baroness  Renni  to lead an assault on Piltover’s memorial for council members killed by Jinx. While feigning sympathy for Piltover’s loss, she used their grief as leverage to convince them to invade Zaun. Her success lies in her strategic use of emotional manipulation, turning the Chem-Baroness's sorrow into a weapon that served her broader goals
 
 Trivia [ ] 
 The word ""Ambessa"" means ""Lion"" in the Ethiopian language. 
 Ambessa is the first character release after Arcane series as the official champion of League of Legends.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 
 I'm a misfit too, I suppose.
 
 Caitlyn to  Jayce ,  Some Mysteries Are Better Left Unsolved 
 Born into the wealthy Kiramman family, Caitlyn always felt that her parents, especially  her mother , sheltered her, thus hindering her personal growth in their hopes of protecting her and convincing her to follow in her footsteps to effectively carry on their family name. [1] [2] [3] 
 Caitlyn grew to become a very skilled marksman. Once, she joined a competition in Piltover and won the trophy. She confronted her closest opponent in the competition, the  Piltover Police Department  Sheriff  Grayson , about throwing the competition for her, suspecting that her parents had paid her to do it. Grayson admitted to letting her win only because she felt that the girl deserved it, not because of her parents, then asked her what she was shooting for. [2] 
 She also became very close to  Jayce Talis , an Academy student her parents were sponsoring. Caitlyn was with him when his laboratory exploded after a break-in, angering her mother further about the risk Jayce had apparently put her in. Though Caitlyn and her father managed to convince her mother to speak for Jayce during the trial, it ultimately still went against his favor, much to Caitlyn's disappointment. [4] 
 Caitlyn eventually joined the  Piltover Police Department  and became an enforcer. Through the cases she encountered and her investigations, Caitlyn came to the theory that  someone  was secretly at the center of all the violence the Undercity was involved in. Her investigations on this were never taken seriously, however, because they were being dismissed and unknowingly stonewalled by the Sheriff during her time,  Marcus , who was, in fact, in cahoots with the man she was investigating. [1] [5] 
 
 Season 1 [ ]

 [2]

 [9] 
 Caitlyn is introduced as an ambitious young woman who rejects the expectations of her aristocratic family. Rather than pursuing a life of luxury, she chooses to join the Piltover enforcers, driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to make a difference. Her sharp intellect, investigative skills, and determination quickly set her apart from her peers. However, Caitlyn’s idealism often clashes with the corruption and bureaucracy within Piltover’s law enforcement system.
 Her journey takes a significant turn when she investigates the explosion at Jayce’s lab and its connection to Zaun. This leads her to Vi, an imprisoned fighter from Zaun knowledgeable about the criminal underworld. Caitlyn frees Vi from Stillwater Prison, forming an unlikely partnership that becomes central to the story. Despite their vastly different upbringings, Caitlyn and Vi develop mutual respect and trust as they work together to uncover the growing tensions between Piltover and Zaun.
 Through her alliance with Vi, Caitlyn gains firsthand exposure to the struggles of Zaun’s oppressed citizens. This challenges her privileged worldview and deepens her understanding of systemic inequality. Her experiences in Zaun strengthen her resolve to fight for justice, not just in Piltover but for both cities. Caitlyn’s compassion and moral clarity often serve as a counterbalance to Vi’s more impulsive tendencies, making their partnership both dynamic and complementary.
 Caitlyn also plays a key role in uncovering Silco’s schemes and his use of shimmer to consolidate power in Zaun. Her investigative prowess helps expose the corruption and danger threatening both cities. However, as tensions escalate between Piltover and Zaun, Caitlyn finds herself caught between loyalty to her city and her growing empathy for Zaun’s plight.
 By the end of Season 1, Caitlyn emerges as a more mature and determined figure. Her relationship with Vi deepens into a bond marked by mutual care and understanding, laying the foundation for their future partnership. Despite witnessing immense violence and betrayal—culminating in Jinx’s catastrophic attack on the Piltover Council—Caitlyn remains steadfast in her commitment to justice.
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Caitlyn begins the season mourning the death of her mother, Cassandra Kiramman, who was killed during Jinx’s attack on the Piltover Council in the Season 1 finale. This devastating loss pushes Caitlyn into a darker mindset, fueling her desire for revenge against Jinx and Zaun. As a leader within Piltover’s enforcers, Caitlyn becomes more determined and ruthless in her pursuit of justice. Her grief drives her to make morally questionable decisions, including actions that risk innocent lives, which creates tension in her relationship with Vi. Despite their growing romantic bond, Caitlyn’s unrelenting focus on vengeance sometimes shocks and alienates Vi.
 Caitlyn’s political role expands when Ambessa Medarda appoints her as head of Piltover’s Council. Though initially reluctant to accept such a position, Caitlyn sees it as an opportunity to protect Piltover from further chaos. However, her alliance with Ambessa—a Noxian warlord with her own agenda—complicates Caitlyn’s moral compass. As she works to consolidate power and suppress Zaun’s rebellion, Caitlyn begins to question whether her actions align with the ideals she once stood for.
 Throughout the season, Caitlyn’s relationship with Vi serves as a grounding force. After being separated for months, their reunion rekindles Caitlyn’s sense of purpose and humanity. Together, they face challenges such as rescuing Vander (now transformed into Warwick) and confronting Ambessa’s manipulations. These experiences force Caitlyn to reflect on how far she has strayed from her principles and help her rediscover the values that define her.
 In the final battle, Caitlyn plays a pivotal role in defending Piltover against Ambessa and Noxian forces. Despite suffering significant injuries—including losing an eye during a duel with Ambessa—Caitlyn demonstrates courage and resilience. She ultimately rejects Ambessa’s influence and recommits herself to protecting Piltover without compromising her integrity.
 By the end of the season, Caitlyn reconciles with Vi in an emotional moment that symbolizes hope for their relationship and their shared mission. Wearing an eyepatch from her injuries, Caitlyn reflects on her journey while reaffirming her dedication to justice. Her arc concludes with a sense of redemption as she moves forward with renewed clarity and strength.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 When she first appears, Caitlyn is a young, curious, and fairly sheltered upper-class child, albeit somewhat of an outcast, isolated by her family's wealth. 
 Even as a young teen, Caitlyn is determined and dedicated, as shown in her shooting tournament with Grayson, and something that sticks with her later in her adulthood. Her level-headedness and strong moral compass lead her to be an enforcer against her parent's wishes. However, her tendency to follow her heart before her head leads to her being isolated from fellow enforcers again and causing problems for her corrupt higher-ups.
 She is deeply compassionate and empathetic, but her naïvety often causes her to come off as stuck up to the people of the Undercity and sometimes her fellow Piltovans.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Caitlyn is 6,1 (185cm) tall with heels (about 5,8 (172cm) without), with a lean frame and toned muscles from her training as an enforcer. 
 She has sharp, angular facial features, bright blue eyes, pale lips, and fair skin. Her dark navy blue hair falls just below her collarbone and is styled in a side part for her appearances in  episodes four  and  five . She later puts her hair up in a ponytail to keep it out of her face while in the lanes. 
 For her first few appearances (as an adult), she wears an enforcer uniform, which is made up of a short-sleeved, navy blue dress with a white panel in the center of the bodice and gold detailing, ending in a loose white ruffle just above the knee, on top of which she wears a belt with a gold decorative buckle, navy blue shoulder pads/epaulets with gold details, and she a white ruffled collar, held in place thin black band and gold buckle. In addition, she wears dark brown knee-high boots, white socks, and fingerless gloves/arm coverings in the same colors. As part of the uniform, she also has a tall, brimless hat in the enforcer's signature blue and white.
 When she changes outfits to blend in while she's with  Vi  in  Zaun , she keeps her boots, but now wears a white undershirt, dark lilac vest, and matching trousers, with a piece of brown, leather-like material which is attached to the purple bodice by gold buttons on her shoulders, with added gold detail, widening from the small of her back to end in a skirt just below her hips buttoned under her bust and secured by two belts on the sides. A sleeve in the same color covers her right arm, and on her left, she wears a brown elbow-length fingerless glove and a white ruffled armband secured with a belt and buckle on her upper arm. In addition, she wears a small choker with a gold pendant.
 She is later captured by  Jinx  and put back in her enforcer outfit in  episode 9 .
 In Act 1 of Season 2 Caitlyn wears a new enforcer outfit. The outfit consists of a navy blue jacket with a lighter middle, and has golden accents and brown straps on the shoulders and arms, with the right sleeve being black and with a shoulder pad adorned with gold. She wears a white frilly undershirt with a red choker, and wears a white beret with golden accents.
 In Act 2 Caitlyn wears her hair down with a long black cape. The cape is also accented with gold and a large red collar.
 In her battle outfit she wears the same black and gold armor that  Jayce  and  Vi  wear on their chests. This outfit has her with her hair back up, as well as black army pants and large black and golden shoulder pads.
 In the ending, she wears a black turtleneck and blue eye-patch.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Precision shooting. 
 Noxian martial arts. 
 Trivia [ ] 
 The name of Caitlyn's House (previously unnamed in  League of Legends ) was conceived by  Arcane  writer  Amanda Overton . [10]  The name has since been adapted in  League  canon. [11] 
 Caitlyn didn't appear in the alternate timeline in Season 2, Episode 7, and there is currently no credible source explaining her status in that timeline. 
 Caitlyn is in her 20s. 
 Caitlyn's official height, including the heels, is 185 cm (6'1). However, her and the other characters' heights are tweaked and adjusted to fit in specific scenes.

 Biography [ ] 
 History [ ] 
 Through her family's political influence and power, Cassandra earned a position on the Council of Piltover.
 At one point, she and her husband saw talent and ambition in young  Jayce Talis  and decided to support his education and research at the Academy as his patron. They granted him access to their building in the Academy district to serve as his workshop. [2] 
 
 Season I [ ] 
 Years later, when the workshop they were letting Jayce work out of was blown up after a break-in, Jayce's illicit research into the  Arcane  was exposed. Cassandra's husband was infuriated that Jayce had inadvertently placed  Caitlyn , who'd been at risk with him at the time. However, Cassandra and her daughter still decided to speak in favor of Jayce during the trial. Though she initially tried to speak about his good character and potential contributions to society, the trial quickly turned in his favor when he spoke about trying to create magic through science. Cassandra then agreed to the motion to expel him from the Academy without further objections. She refused to speak with Jayce further and even tried to keep Caitlyn from becoming friends with him. [2] 
 With  Councilor Medarda's  machinations, however, Jayce and his new partner  Viktor  managed to perfect his research, later   Hextech , and he was given the authority to continue working on it. [3]  Mrs. Kiramman eventually became one of the many entrepreneurs in Piltover to benefit from the creation of the  Hexgates . [4] 
 Eventually, her only daughter Caitlyn chose to become an  enforcer , a decision that she disapproved of. A few years later, Caitlyn was injured in an explosion that occurred at the end of Piltover's  Progress Day  and had killed six other enforcers. Fearing for her safety, Cassandra and her husband had Marcus remove her from the force.
 After the incident that also resulted in the theft of Jayce's Hextech Gemstone, the Council agreed to add him to their table as a Councilor. [3]  Jayce's new position made him aware of the regular corruption and bribery that occurred among businesses using his gates and ordered the strengthening of security, causing the Councilors and others to plot against him. Convinced by Mel, Jayce earned back the Council's favor by forging his own deals with each of them, including Cassandra. [4]  With this, she and the rest of the Council were easily convinced to agree with Jayce's later suggestion to force Heimerdinger to retire from the Council. [5] 
 Despite Caitlyn's dismissal as an enforcer, she continued to investigate her theories on  Zaun 's  underground crime organization . Caitlyn found her way to Zaun with a  guide  and returned a few days later, once again injured from another deadly explosion on the bridge, asking for a chance to present her findings to the Council. Caitlyn tried to explain to her how horrid the living situation was in Zaun and how the Council's passiveness was making it worse; with some convincing, she got them an audience at their next meeting. Despite their testimony on  Silco , the Council tried diplomacy instead to avoid initiating a war against the undercity. [6] 
 Jayce later informed the Council of a deal he'd made with Silco—their peace and the surrender of  the one  responsible for the recent explosions in exchange for Zaun's independence. After some discussion and objections, the Council unanimously agreed, only for the meeting to be bombed by Jinx with a rocket-powered by Jayce's Hextech Gemstone, with her daughter being able to witness the bombing from a safe distance away. [7] 
 
 Season II [ ] 
 Cassandra tragically dies in the attack, along with Councilors  Bolbok  and  Hoskel . Her mother's loss becomes a pivotal moment in Caitlyn's journey, deeply affecting her emotionally and shaping her motivations going forward. After the funeral, Caitlyn struggles with grief, questioning her role in continuing her mother's legacy. This loss also catalyzes her formation of a strike team to hunt down Jinx and dismantle the forces that threaten Piltover, including those linked to the Chem-Barons and Silco
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Cassandra is a noble woman, though she is generous. At first glance she comes off as posh and stuck up, but we see in Season One and Season Two that she cares for the people above and below her as well. When Jayce's research was compromised by  Heimerdinger  she still supports him, being his patron of many years. When Caitlyn and Vi return from the undercity she eventually gives in to her daughters pleas for change by scheduling an audience for them with the council. She also votes for  Zaun 's freedom in episode 9. In Season Two, we learn that she had funded a ventilation system in the undercity to free them from the  Grey . This shows that even though she is a powerful and rich noble of Piltover, she still cares for the people close to her but also those in the undercity.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Cassandra is a fair-skinned woman with an angular face and brown (later greying) hair. She has teal eyes and blue jewel earrings. Her outfit consists of a white ruffled undershirt with a black bowtie, covered by a maroon jacket with golden buttons. She wears a long maroon skirt and white gloves.

 I remember the first time I saw you at the Academy. You reminded me of myself. A scientist ready to forge a new vector of experimentation. But sometimes we venture too far. No great science should ever put lives in danger.

 Biography [ ] 
 History [ ] 
 Heimerdinger was one of the founders of Piltover. [1]  According to  Councilor Bolbok , the city was established to escape the warmongering of  mages , [2]  with Heimerdinger himself having lived through at least one of those  wars . Ultimately, coming out of the conflict mentally and emotionally scarred with a strong paranoia and distrust for anything or anyone involved with magic. [2] [1] 
 At one point, he worked with a scientist known as  Singed , whose more radical experiments Heimerdinger presumably objected to, leading to the latter's departure. [3] 
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 When Academy scholar  Jayce Talis 's workshop was caught in an explosion due to a break-in by  Zaunite  children, Heimerdinger sent his assistant  Viktor  to ensure that anything dangerous in the workshop was safely dealt with. He then visited Jayce personally in his cell and asked him about his unsanctioned research. When he found out that the boy was working on harnessing  magic  through science, Heimerdinger warned him of the dangers and advised him to let go of his dream and not to mention it during his Council hearing — advice that Jayce ultimately ignored. After  Jayce's mother  spoke to plead her son's case, instead of banishment as Councilor  Bolbok  first suggested, Heimerdinger instead moved to expel him from the Academy, which the whole Council agreed to. [2] 
 Despite the warnings, Jayce continued working on his  Hextech  project, this time with Viktor's help and encouragement from  Councilor Medarda . In a short amount of time, Jayce, with new knowledge supplied by Viktor, got the Hextech to function without destructive results. [4]  No longer able to deny its potential benefits, Jayce's research was encouraged and eventually led to the creation of the Hexgates that soon made Piltover a central trading port, advancing the city's progress decades ahead.
 When Jayce and Viktor tried to pitch their next Hextech plans to Heimerdinger, he was pleased with their new research but told them that it would only be ready for use years down the line after further studying to ensure its safety. [5]  When the duo showed Heimerdinger the Hexcore, he recognized its similarity to the kind of power he'd encountered from the past and feared and told them to destroy it, disappointing the pair — both of whom were desperate to use it somehow to cure Viktor and Jayce who wanted to fight back against the recent attacks on Piltover by Zaunites.
 His continued objection led to Jayce moving during their next Council meeting to force him to retire, with the other Councilors backing him due to Heimerdinger's speech about holding each other accountable in addition to deals Jayce had made with them with Mel's guidance, [1]  after which Jayce became his replacement as the de facto head. [3] 
 After his eviction from the Council, Heimerdinger went to Zaun, hoping to assist them. On his way back, he saw and was impressed with a hoverboard and met its owner,  Ekko . With the boy's leg injured, [6]  Heimerdinger accompanies him, and Ekko brings him back with him to the  Firelights'  base, where the two began discussing their thoughts on his inventions, particularly his hoverboard. [7] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Heimerdinger is an empathetic mentor with a love for science and education. While he cares a lot about the safety of his people, his near immortality and PTSD caused by the Rune Wars cause him to act rashly in response to anything related to magic, even when it can save lives. His trust in most people and his ironic naivety caused him to be somewhat complacent, as he was mostly unaware of the corruption in the Council or the brutality of the enforcers in  Zaun . He was both a typical wise elder who was ignored by corrupt politicians and a traumatized child who needed therapy. He was too focused on potential dangers to see the present issues.

 History [ ] 
 ""Chross"" was once a citizen of  Piltover  who moved to  Zaun  when he realized that his skill set, and personality worked well in the undercity. Chross made a name for himself as the ruthless and clever leader of a highly organized and dangerous gang. Soon, he became affiliated with other crime lords, [1]  forming the group of  chem-barons  that control the undercity, led by  Silco . [2]  Because of Silco's connections in Piltover, officers have been unable to track him down nor pin most crimes on him.
 At one point, one of his most infamous hitmen,  Nero Eso , was apprehended by  enforcers . Because he was captured by someone other than Silco's upper city asset,  Marcus , the hitman was interrogated, though he refused to give any substantial information on him and Silco. Nero was apparently ordered by Silco to leave Progress Day pins at the sites of his hits as a reminder to Chross of his origins. Another enforcer,  Caitlyn Kiramman , found the records of this and kept it as part of an ongoing investigation on  the underground's then unknown ruler  and his  mole  in Piltover. [1] 
 After the actions of Silco's adoptive daughter  Jinx  caused the closure of the borders to Piltover, Chross and the other chem-barons' businesses were affected. They called a meeting to discuss their next action, during which  Finn  tried to convince them to stand their ground against Silco and his unwillingness to stop Jinx's antics. Before they could discuss further, Silco arrived and unleashed a toxic gas in the air before giving them gas masks, reminding them of the insufferable past he'd saved them from. [2]

 Biography [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Claggor was part of  Vi's  trip to  Piltover  to steal valuables with her,  Powder  and  Mylo . They were discovered after Powder accidentally caused the explosion. This sets off a manhunt through the streets of Piltover, though they eventually escape. Back on the other side of the river,  Deckard  is waiting for them, and a fight ensues. They win, but the valuables they stole are lost by Powder by accident. Later that evening, Vander takes him to  Benzo 's, where he has to wait outside. When the  Enforcers  arrive,  Ekko  urges him to leave and he runs away. [1] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ]

 Appearance [ ] 
 Claggor is a stocky teenager who is quite blocky in appearance, which is a nice ode to the use of shape language in Arcane. He seems to be the biggest of the teens, maybe besides Vi. Clag has mouse brown hair that sits atop his head in soft waves parted above his right eye. His outfit consists of a shabby white long-sleeve shirt, with these bands of twine holding the fabric in sections to his arms. He has what looks like greenish archers brace over his right, turning it a stirrup that fits over the top of his hand. He has a leather belt that loops through some burlap-looking pants and thick, clunky shoes. And we can't forget his iconic goggles, which make him look like Bobble from the Tinkerbell movie series.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 In his youth, Ekko worked for  Benzo  at his shop and often eavesdropped on his more private conversations even when the man would send him away. This made him privy to certain transactions and secrets that he would sometimes share with his friends:  Vi ,  Mylo ,  Claggor , and  Powder .
 Growing up, Ekko looked up to Vi and played with her younger sister, Powder. Vi taught him some fighting moves, [2]  He would sometimes go to the junk heap with Vi, who would then hose him down when he got too dirty. [1] 
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 While working at Benzo's one day,  a man  from  Piltover  came into the shop and bought items from him. [2] [3]  Ekko was easily able to charge him twice the items' normal price and then followed him. Thinking his friends could make quick cash off the man, Ekko told Vi about the workshop. The plan backfired when  Powder  accidentally caused an explosion in the man's home, initiating an investigation that led  enforcers  to Benzo's to confront  Vander .
 Despite being kicked out by Benzo prior so he and Vander could speak privately, Ekko listened in through a contraption he'd built above the room and found out that Vander had a deal with the  Sheriff , [2]  which he later told Vi with some hesitation. [3] 
 Ekko later witnessed Benzo's murder in the hands of a  Shimmer -affected  Deckard  under  Silco 's orders. He saw Silco and his men take Vander away and later tearfully told Vi where to find them — Silco's Shimmer factory. Shortly after, multiple explosions at the factory resulted in multiple deaths and Vi's disappearance, [4]  leading him to assume that she had also perished. Meanwhile,  Powder  was taken in by Silco, causing the two to be estranged.
 Forced to find a means to survive, Ekko eventually came to live in hiding with a group of other children, building their base in a rare space that housed one of the very few trees—if not the only tree—to survive in  Zaun . The group called themselves  the Firelights , after the  glowing insects  found in Zaun, [1]  and began sabotaging Silco's shipments of Shimmer in hopes of hindering its damage to their city. [5] [1] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 When Ekko was younger, he had a carefree and goofy attitude, he quickly made best friends with  Powder  due to how playful the both were. He was very enthusiastic about fighting hand to hand and looked up to  Vi  like an older sibling.  However, once  Benzo  was killed, and when he presumed that Vi perished in the explosions, his relationship with Powder also deteriorated as she joined forces with the same people who killed Benzo. 
 Ekko matured considerably, taking charge as the leader of the Firelights. Despite all the trauma inflicted on him, Ekko chose to fight for the people and focus on helping addicts and victims affected by Silco's  Shimmer  operation.  While he does retain his enthusiasm for his inventions and fighting, he is more reserved around people he's not familiar or comfortable around. 
 Because Ekko was born and raised in Zaun, the lower city, he has a biased negative opinion on Piltover residents, shown notably with his interactions with Caitlyn. He does seem to respect Heimerdinger, despite him being a former-council member at the time of their meeting. 
 Although Ekko keeps a tough exterior, it's clear that he keeps a lot of his emotions bottled inside. When he put up a front and acted cold against Vi, she was able to see right through the act, and embraced him, leading him to start crying. 
 Ekko is also particularly strong willed when it comes to moral choices, as when he had the opportunity to stay in the alternate universe where Piltover and Zaun were united, Powder was his girlfriend, and where every character who died in the original timeline is alive (Except Vi dies during their workshop heist in this universe), he chose to leave it so that he could go back and save everyone in his timeline. 
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Ekko is of average height with a wiry, athletic build. His skin is a rich dark brown, contrasting sharply with his thick white hair. He styles his hair into bundled locks on top of his head, with the sides buzzed short. 
 His dark brown eyes, once soft and round in childhood, now carry a sharper, more intense expression. His eyebrows are straight and slightly angled downward, and his wide nose complements his defined facial structure. High cheekbones taper into a pointed chin, giving his face a sharp and distinct profile.
 Ekko’s attire reflects his life in Zaun and his leadership of the Firelights. He wears an oversized dark green jacket covered in neon graffiti-like scribbles, paired with baggy, off-white pants. An orange bandana tied around his neck is a signature part of his look. During combat, he often wears a white tank top for ease of movement.
 His most distinctive feature is the white hourglass symbol painted across his face, stretching from his forehead to the tip of his nose.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Time Rewind : Ekko can manipulate time with the Zero Drive that he created with the help of Heimerdinger. He is capable of returning up to 4 seconds, however his physical condition remains unchanged. Attempting to rewind more than 4 seconds can cause harm against his surroundings, but strangely not Ekko himself. 
 Hand-to-hand combat : Ekko is an excellent combatant in close quarters, being capable of evading Jinx's bullets and then subduing her.
 Inventor/Genius Intellect:  Ekko has always been adept at building inventions, and has impressed the likes of Heimerdinger, who has considerable knowledge as an immortal being. Ekko was also able to develop the Z-Drive by inverting Jayce's Acceleration Rune (with the help of AU Powder and Heimerdinger), showing that he can grasp arcane topics almost as well as Jayce
 
 Trivia [ ] 
 Ekko liked his earrings in the alternate universe so much so that he got them pierced in his own universe. [6] [7]

 Biography [ ] 
 Stillwater [ ] 
 Gert is one of many Jinxers that were arrested at the Vander Statue and taken to  Stillwater Hold . When  Jinx  and  Sevika  break into the prison to save them, Gert touches Jinx’s shoulder in a comforting way. The other Jinxers follow her in suit as they leave the prison. This leaves a lasting effect on Jinx as she realizes the people of Zaun believe in her, and see her as a symbol.
 
 The Noxus and Piltover Battle [ ] 
 Gert and some other Zaunites join forces with the uppercity to help fight in the battle between them and  Ambessa ’s forces. Somewhere during the fight she is injured and  Vi  carries her between fights to another building, where she then dies.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Through her few scenes, Gert appears to be a strong-willed and determined person. She participates in revolts against the uppercity as well as being apart of the Jinxers. In the end, she chose to help others in the fight against Ambessa and  Viktor  and died for it.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Gert is muscular and stocky, a similar body type to Vi. She has warm brown skin that’s littered with freckles. She has a scar on her upper lip, two silver bolt-like eyebrow piercings, and blue side-swept dreadlocks. She wears blue and pink eye makeup in honor of Jinx, and dark purple lipstick.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 Grayson is from  Piltover . At some point in her life, she became an Enforcer to protect the city and bring justice. She was a Kiramman family friend and has known  Caitlyn  since she was very young. Grayson participated in a shooting competition, which Caitlyn won, but she found out Grayson held back and shot later. After this, during a cocktail made by the Kirammans to celebrate Caitlyn's victory, Grayson was outside relaxing when Caitlyn approached and asked if her parents paid her to let her win, something Grayson denied. She said to the girl that she thought she deserved to win. Then, with honesty, Grayson said that as an Enforcer, how she uses her weapon helps protect others and bring justice and that it's trophy enough for her. She asked Caitlyn what she was shooting for. Somewhere before season 1, Grayson became Sheriff of the Piltover Enforcers, and she made a deal with  Vander . She would keep her people out of his streets, and he would do the same. [1] 
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 After  Vi  and her siblings had caused a stir in  Piltover , Greyson was sent to  Zaun  to find the people responsible. She went to talk with Vander inside  Benzo 's shop in the company of  Marcus . The people from the topside wanted to blame someone for the explosion caused by the people of Zaun. Greyson reminded Vander of their deal, but he was unwilling to give her any names. Accepting her defeat in this matter, Greyson left the shop, but not before giving Vander a way to contact her if he changed his mind. [1] 
 Inside  Jayce's  ruined workshop, Grayson interviews a perturbed Jayce who understands that his workshop was broken into and destroyed. However, she points out that most of Jayce's possessions don't have permits for them.  Viktor , who was also there, asked what had happened there, and Jayce answered with a scoff, ""Science"", but Grayson mentioned that it doesn't give the right to have illegal equipment. Viktor then uses his authority to have Jayce arrested for possessing illegal equipment. [2] 
 Eventually, Grayson leads Jayce to the  Piltover Council  chambers, where his trial will be held. [2] 
 Sometime after the trial, Grayson reports to the Council about the investigation surrounding the thieves who stole from Jayce's workshop. However, Council members  Torman Hoskel  and  Salo  scorn Grayson's progress, citing its inadequacies in figuring out who did it. Grayson's partner,  Marcus , speaks up and claims they'll find them. Chiming in, Grayson cites they've conducted thorough searches and interviews of the people down in the  Zaun . However,  Irius Bolbok  demands that more affirmative action be done, even if it means turning the Zaun upside down. [2]

 Biography [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Somewhere before the first episode, Huck makes a deal to do something for two gangsters. They meet in  The last Drop  for payment, but the gangsters are unwilling to pay the agreed-upon price. This is where  Vander  steps in and ensures that Huck is treated fairly. [1] 
 Huck appears sitting in a corner, listening to the debate between Vander and  Sevika  about how to approach the  Enforcers  from  Piltover . [2] 
 Huck is not seen again for a while, until Episode 6, "" When These Walls Come Tumbling Down "". He is seen approaching  Caitlyn , asking about Vi's well-being, saying she is an old friend as her old man saved her life. Caitlyn asks Huck for a doctor, and Huck informs her that it is very hard to come by down below, but he informs her of a potion maker who helps with ailments, especially those related to shimmer usage. He takes her to the potion maker, and as the potion maker passes the potion laced with Shimmer to Caitlyn, there is a brief glimpse of Huck staring at the Shimmer potion and craving it. Caitlyn offers Huck to come see Vi, but he declines as he doesn't want her to see him like this. Caitlyn hugs him to thank him, and she leaves him.
 He is then seen with the other addicts taking Shimmer from Silco, with the implication being that he had told Silco where Caitlyn and Vi were hiding.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Huck can be timid, but when it comes to being scorned or slighted in any way, he's known to lash out when he is in the right.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 When you first meet Huck, he is a slender man sporting brown hair tied back into a ponytail and glasses. The last time we see him, due to his excessive usage of Shimmer. He has become more slender, with hollowed-out cheekbones, and his glasses appear to be broken. Instead of brown eyes, his eyes have turned pink from his excessive Shimmer usage, along with purple veins appearing around them. One of his most prominent features is the purple tumors protruding out of his head from his overuse of Shimmer.

 Biography [ ] 
 History [ ] 
 At one point, Bolbok's race was almost annihilated by what he deemed to be warmongering  mages . [1] 
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 When the workshop of an Acaddemy scholar named  Jayce Talis  was robbed and accidentally blown up, his unauthorized experimentation with exploiting magic crystals was discovered, becoming a cause for concern of the Council. Bolbok moved for Jayce's banishment as stated in their Ethos, but  Heimerdinger  instead moved for him to be expelled from the Academy and banned from his research instead. [1]  With  Councilor Medarda's  machinations, however, Jayce and his new partner  Viktor  managed to perfect Jayce's  Hextech  research. He was given the authority to work on it. [2]  Bolbok eventually became one of the many businessmen in Piltover to benefit from Jayce's creation of  Hexgates .
 At one point, newly appointed Councilor Jayce ordered strengthening security and inspection of trades made through the Hexgates. As Bolbok and his associates had dealt with  enforcers  and the rest of the Council to ease their transactions, despite possibly shady dealings, Bolbok and the others began discussing alternatives or what to do about Jayce. Jayce managed to win back their favor soon after with deals of his own. [3]  With this, Bolbok and the rest of the Council were easily convinced to agree with Jayce's suggestion to force Heimerdinger to retire from the Council. [4] 
 When an explosion on the bridge caused by a  Zaunite  resulted in the deaths of multiple enforcers, and their  Sheriff's  deceit was discovered, the Council convened to discuss their next action.  Councilor Kiramman's  daughter  Caitlyn  arrived to address them and told them about  Silco . Though Bolbok quickly shot down her statements as baseless due to prior investigations yielding no results, Caitlyn proved her point by pointing out that the investigations were led by their corrupt late Sheriff. [5]  Jayce later came to their next meeting with the proposition to grant Zaun their independence. After some discussion and objections, the Council unanimously agreed, only for the meeting to be bombed by  Jinx  with a missile powered by Jayce's Hextech Gemstone. [6]  Along with two others, Bolbok died during this incident. [7]

 Meeting Jinx [ ] 
 Isha meets her for the first time after running away from Zaunite goons chasing her down for unspecified reasons. After jumping across the other end of a broken pipe she eventually loses her grip and falls off, landing on a cloaked figure and knocking them both down. The goons eventually surround them until the hood lifts to reveal Jinx, shocking and catching them off guard. Jinx rapidly pulls out her handgun and subsequently shoots them all — saving Isha.
 Jinx gives a small talk to Isha before concealing herself once more with her hood, walking away. Isha, having nowhere to go, follows behind.
 
 Sacrifice [ ] 
 As Jinx tries to communicate with the enraged Vander, the towering beast swipes her away, launching her off her feet. Isha watches on petrified and conflicted as the scene unfolds in front of her: the sight of Jinx writhing in pain, Vander battling with the Noxian soldiers, and an injured  Vi  being supported by  Caitlyn . A newfound determination awakening within her, she takes a  Hextech   Gemstone  in stored in her pouch and heads toward the scuffle as memories of her time together with Jinx flashes through her mind as she ran, tears flying off as she holds the gemstone close and presses on. Leaping off a shield, she lands near Jinx's handgun lying by the dirt and grabs it as she slides across the ground, passing by Jinx on the way. 
 Isha loads the handgun with two more gemstones, amplifying its firepower. Realizing what Isha is doing, Jinx is alarmed and stumbles as she tries to chase after her before Vi stops her. Isha momentarily halts underneath Vander, meeting Jinx's gaze. With tears in her eyes, she does a finger gun before pointing the pulsating gun up towards Vander. Closing her eyes, she pulls the trigger, causing the area to burst into a blinding explosion of arcane magic.
 
 Legacy [ ] 
 Her death affects Jinx, causing her to turn herself in and get arrested. Jinx ends up very depressed and takes her braids out leaving her long hair loose, before chopping it off to shoulder length.
 Her death may have caused Jinx to sacrifice herself to end Vander once and for all.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Isha appears to be a bold child, almost instantly bonding with Jinx after she kills the mobsters that were chasing her. She grows fond of Jinx, as seen in episode 3 where she interposes Jinx and Vi, saving the former from getting killed by pointing her gun at her sister's face.
 Although having witnessed numerous acts of violence and deaths, most of them by Jinx's hands, she doesn't seem to be affected by it, enjoying the chaos that comes with them.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Isha is a thin, brown haired child with amber eyes. In episode 4 she gets her hair dyed blue, and appears to have drawn numerous sketches and scribbles over her clothes. She's often seen wearing a safari-like hat with goggles, also covered with sketches from episode 4 onwards.

 Trivia [ ] 
 She's seen carrying a spyglass and sometimes a shovel. 
 She is non-verbal, as proved by the fact that she never speaks a word, but only makes simple vocal sounds, and that she uses some sort of sign language with Jinx in episode 4. 
 Isha’s theme song is entirely in Chinese. 
 Her goggles and hat resemble that of  Teemo . 
 The name Isha translates to “one who protects” in Hindu, and “life” in Arabic.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 
 When Jayce was young, he and  his mother  got caught in a snowstorm, seemingly with no one around for miles. Just when his mother collapsed, a  cloaked man  arrived who used  magic  to warp them a safe distance away from the blizzard. The man left Jayce the crystal he'd used for his spell. This encounter shaped young Jayce's desire to learn more about magic and conduct research to harness magic through science later in his life. [2] 
 Being part of House Talis, a family of renowned toolmakers most known for their hammers and the collapsible pocket wrench, most expected Jayce to join their family business. [2] [3]  Jayce, however, was determined in his research into science and the  Arcane . Eventually, he became a scholar at the Academy in Piltover, where he was favored by the Dean and the Head of the Council, Professor  Heimerdinger , and by the Kirammans, who saw his ambition and decided to support him as his patron. [2] 
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Act 1 [ ] 
 Sometime after buying supplies from  Benzo's  in  the Lanes , [4] [2]  Jayce returned to his workshop just in time for him to realize that it had been broken into.  One  of the children inside accidentally dropped one of his many unstable crystals and caused an explosion. This alerted Heimerdinger, the authorities, and the Council of his unauthorized research, and he was put on trial in front of the Council.
 Despite Heimerdinger's suggestion, Jayce told the Council about his research being for harnessing magic through science, invoking fear among the Council of the dangers of unchecked magic in the hands of those with no innate Arcane talent. Councilor  Bolbok  moved to have Jayce exiled, after which  Jayce's mother  stepped forward and pled his case. Heimerdinger allowed it and instead asked the Council for a more lenient punishment—Jayce's expulsion from the Academy.  Councilor Kiramman  turned her back on Jayce. However, their daughter  Caitlyn  maintained her belief in him, and he was resigned to the idea that he would have to follow in his father's footsteps after all.
 
 
 That research is everything. My… my whole life.
 
 Jayce, "" The Base Violence Necessary for Change "" 
 
 To Jayce, his punishment was worse than death, to the point where he contemplated jumping off of his former workshop's building before he was stopped by Viktor, the Dean's assistant, who decided to help him with his research. [2]  With Viktor's advice, Jayce realized how he could stabilize the crystals. Racing against time to prove the efficacy of his research the day before his equipment is scheduled to be destroyed, Viktor helped him break into Heimerdinger's laboratory to reclaim his crystals and test their theory.
 
 
 Their attempts with their new calculations caused bright lights and a minor explosion that caught the attention of Heimerdinger and the enforcers. Still, by the time they'd forced their way into the laboratory, the crystal had stabilized, with Jayce, Viktor, and other objects around them floating in the air with the crystal. Though Heimerdinger was impressed, he was still conflicted about embracing it due to the risks it posed, but the ambitious  Councilor Medarda  arrived and proclaimed that they should bring it to the Council. [5] 
 
 Act 2 [ ] 
 Mel Medarda Perhaps it's time. For the era of  magic . Jayce Uh,  Hextech . For the era of Hextech. — "" The Base Violence Necessary for Change "" 
 Jayce eventually earned the support of the other Councilors. Years later, Jayce met the Council's conditions to allow him and Viktor to continue their research—they further stabilized the crystal and created Hexgates that revolutionized trade and transportation for Piltover and the world, putting Piltover on the map as the global shipping lane. He and Viktor hoped to present their latest findings where their stable  Hextech  Gemstone could be used to power tools to make work easier for their laborers. Though impressed, Heimerdinger advised the two that they needed more time to ensure its safety.
 For Progress Day, the Council had Jayce give the speech addressing the attendees, an honor usually only done by Heimerdinger. Before the end of the day,  a Zaunite  stole the Gemstone; in fear of the thief potentially weaponizing it, Jayce suggested to the Council that they shut down all Hextech operations, worrying the Councilors who had business dependent on the gates.  Mel  then recommended that Jayce be instated as a Council member to serve his goal of safeguarding the Hexgates better and thus all matters dependent on it—a radical suggestion since the Council has traditionally only held seven seats. With Heimerdinger's agreement, the rest of the Council followed, and Jayce became the eighth Councilor. [3] 
 [6] 
 [7] 
 
 Act 3 [ ] 
 [8] 
 [9] 
 [10] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Jayce is an ambitious, somewhat gullible (in earlier episodes), and creative person. In Act 1 of Season 1, he has a dream for  Hextech  and is confident in its potential. He has a passion for his invention and when he and Viktor successfully harness the Hex crystal, we see a child-like happiness from Jayce.
 Later in Season 1, he becomes less gullible as he makes his way up to be the de-facto leader of The Council. He is more strong-willed with his decisions in politics. We also see his caring side when Viktor grows more sick, and he leaves Mel’s bedside to be with him.
 In Season 2 he leaves behind his occupation as a Council member to pursue his and Viktor’s true dream for Hextech. He acted upon his emotions to save Viktor; by fusing him with the  Hexcore  to revive him. When Viktor leaves he becomes even more emotional, sleeping in the lab in hopes he would return.
 In the Arcane, Jayce grows paranoid and aggressive. Between seeing hallucinations of Mel and Viktor,  Viktor’s Soldiers , the pain of his broken leg, etc., he comes back to the normal universe with a strong passion to kill Viktor in hopes of saving everyone. He is aggressive in his actions, but only from his paranoia of the Soldiers and his experiences in the Arcane.
 In Act 3, he is slightly less paranoid but still strong-willed about ending Viktor. In the Cosmic Realm where he talks to Viktor, he shows his true compassion for his partner. He says that Viktor’s “imperfections” were apart of what made Jayce admire him. In the end, he chooses to sacrifice himself to aid Viktor in ending the magic.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Jayce has a muscular build with light brown skin. He has slicked back brown hair and thick eyebrows, with a permanent 5 o’clock shadow. Jayce has a tooth gap. In Act 1, he wears his academy outfit that consists of a maroon dress shirt, white and blue vest, red necktie, and black pants. In the rest of the season, he wears a white and gold jacket with dark red shoulder pads that contain the Talis family crest. He has dark red pants and black boots.
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 While stuck in the Arcane, Jayce becomes disheveled and dirty. His hair grows out into a middle part, and he grows a beard. His regular outfit is now un-buttoned; revealing a grey shirt underneath. His lips are chapped and scarred, and the Rune he had on his bracelet is now fused into his wrist. He disassembled his  hammer  to build a brace for his left leg.
 Later on in the season, he cleans himself up and wears a black dress shirt and white jacket. He has brown gloves, large black and gold shoulder pads, and other gold detailing on his jacket.
 In his Astral form, his body and hair change colors. His body is typically white, teal, pink, purple, and blue, while his hair is typically white or other colors his body shifts to. His face and hands remain his normal skin color, but with the edition of Viktor’s fingerprint on his forehead that are an array of iridescent colors (normally purple).
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Ingenuity:  Jayce can create many different inventions with passion. Such as his  Mercury Hammer ,  Atlas Gauntlets , and  Hexgates   (with Viktor's help) 
 Durability:  He is able to survive for an extended period of time in a deserted cave and leg injury. 
 Strength:  Jayce is physically strong, as we see in the forge as well as his ability to use the Mercury Hammer.

 Jinx , previously known as  Powder , is one of the main characters in  Arcane . She was an orphaned Zaunite after her parents were tragically slaughtered when she and her sister,  Vi  were younger. They were both taken in by  Vander , the then protector of the Lanes. After Vi had abandoned her after Vander's ""supposed"" death, she came under the care of  Silco , she is fundamentally and irrevocably changed into a nihilistic anarchist, completely rejecting her former identity and past in favor of her new moniker.

 Biography 
 Early life 
 Powder was born to  Felicia and Connol , she was the younger sister of Violet. Growing up, Powder had a good relationship with Vi and her parents. However, when her parents died during a battle on the bridge between  Piltover  and  Zaun , she and Vi were the only people left in their family. After the battle, Vander found the two siblings where he adopted them and raised them as his own, alongside  Mylo  and  Claggor . [1] 
 
 The heist 
 A few years later, Vi, Powder, Claggor, and Mylo venture into Piltover after getting a tip from  Ekko  regarding a Piltover citizen whom he had followed after he shopped at  Benzo 's. After finding the apartment, the kids looted the place where Powder discovers a box full of blue  crystals . However, Vi hears  Jayce  and  Caitlyn 's footsteps. This makes Vi signal everyone to leave. But in the rush, Powder drops one of the blue crystals, setting off an explosion that blows up half the building. This notifies the enforcers and sends the kids on a chase through Piltover. 
 
 The aftermath 
 After the kids evade the enforcers, they return to Zaun with their stolen goods. They are stopped by a street gang led by  Deckard , who demands they hand the bag over. Not willing to go down without a fight, Vi, Claggor, and Mylo take on the rival gang and leave the goods with Powder. Midway, Powder is chased by one of the gang members who notices the stolen supplies. She is cornered at the docks, where she tries to attack him with Mouser, though it sputters out and fails. Left with no other option, she throws the goods away, Which Accidentally lands in the ocean as Powder manages to escape for good. 
 Later, Mylo yells at Powder for losing the stolen goods and claims, ""She jinxes every job,"" though Vi silences him. Back at The Last Drop, Vander reprimands the group for the trouble they caused in Piltover while Vi argues back, claiming that Piltover has plenty while they have nothing. [1] 
 
 Laying low 
 To lay low, the group decides to hide in a run-down arcade. Mylo berates Powder for being unable to fix a target practice range; instead, she shows him how to activate it and plays the range herself, showing Her excellent aim. Enforcers soon break into the arcade, and they run away once more with the help of Ekko.
 Later, several Zaunites gather at the Last Drop, and the group, including Powder, stands by a corner. They watch as several residents, including Sevika, claim they want to fight back, but Vander reminds them that violence is not the answer and that they ""just have to stand together"". The kids wonder why Vander still chooses peace, and Ekko informs them that Vander has a deal with the enforcers.
 While lounging in the basement of the Last Drop, Vander signals the group that enforcers have arrived again. They hide in the rafters, but Powder struggles to hang on; luckily, she manages to keep from falling, and only after the enforcer leaves the basement does she let go. She decides to make more bombs, naming one ""Whisker,"" and she shows them to Vi, who encourages her.
 
 Rescuing Vander 
 When Vi returns to the Last Drop, letting the group know what she saw, they begin to plan a rescue for Vander. Powder insists on joining, but Vi warns her not to and leaves her alone with a flare instead. Powder breaks down afterward; in her breakdown, the Hextech crystals she'd swiped from the penthouse spill out of her bag, and she realizes that those caused the explosion. 
 She makes her way to the docks with a monkey bomb loaded with crystals. She drops the monkey through the window, and explosions are set off, killing Mylo and Claggor alongside several of Silco's goons; Vi and Vander are injured,  Sevika  loses an arm protecting  Silco , and  Singed 's lab blows up with him inside. Powder makes her way to the entrance, only to find Vander dead and Vi extremely anguished, and in that anguish, she angrily calls her a ""jinx"" and leaves her sobbing.
 With no one left, Powder is adopted by Silco. [2] 
 
 Progress day 
 During Piltover's day of celebration, a shipment of  shimmer  is ambushed by  the Firelights , a rebel undercity group, and Powder, having evidently gone insane and now known as Jinx, fighting back mercilessly with her now very effective explosives. Now deadly in combat, she easily takes down multiple Firelights until one of them is unmasked, and her pink hair triggers a hallucination, confusing Jinx with a false image of Vi, causing her to freeze before she realizes it isn't her sister and heartlessly shooting the girl without hesitation. The remaining firelights flee, and she fires on them, putting the rest of her own crew in harm's way. 
 Jinx remains with Silco. The two have formed a father-daughter relationship, albeit an unhealthy one. Silco encourages her to work on her inventions, excuses her blunders, and genuinely cares for her. Her hideout, built over the fissures, allows her time to perfect her explosives, but also shows how trapped by her own memories she is, showing that she kept Vi's rabbit and even made a copy, one in a box and the other nailed to the wall above her desk, along with Claggor's glasses and a life-size doll of Mylo, who appears to her in frequent hallucinations. 
 After her explosive reaction at the shimmer shipment, Silco suggests she take time to collect herself, frustrating her. In an effort to prove herself, she breaks into the  Piltover Council  building, stealing a  hextech  crystal and creating a diversion by starting a fire in a pavilion to lure enforcers into a trap filled with explosives, which kills six enforcers and injures a seventh.
 Despite Silco's initial frustration, the benefits the crystal promises outweigh the risks to his business, and he is quick to forgive.
 
 Searching for Vi 
 When she finds out from Sevika that her sister is alive and in the lanes searching for her, she uses the flare Vi had given her in an attempt to find her. Despite her doubts, Vi shows up, and the pair are reunited. When Caitlyn appears, Jinx turns on the pair, questioning Vi's motivation for returning until the Firelights ambush the trio, and a fight ensues, leading to Vi and Caitlyn being taken and Jinx being left alone yet again.
 
 The Boy Savior 
 Searching for both Vi and the hextech gemstone, Jinx watches from on high as her swarm of mechanical butterflies explodes across a barricaded bridge topside, killing the team of enforcers, including Marcus. Jinx comes face to face with her sister and Caitlyn and fires at them from almost point-blank range, stopped by Ekko intercepting and knocking her back. Ekko faces off against Jinx, allowing Cait and Vi to escape while the two fight. Despite the pair being evenly matched, Ekko pins her down, and Jinx lets off a grenade, dislocating Ekko's leg and nearly killing her. Silco carries the severely injured Jinx to Singed, begging him to save her. The doctor injects her with shimmer, enhancing her strength and speed and ultimately saving her despite the demanding and extremely painful process.
 
 The Tea Party 
 Jinx knocks out and captures Vi, bringing her to what remains of the warehouse where the events of  episode 3  took place, and reveals she has set up a twisted tea party, with Caitlyn and Silco both tied up and gagged at the table. Jinx begs Vi to kill Caitlyn, which she refuses, and Jinx turns on Caitlyn herself, sparing her only because of Vi's pleas, leading to Cait firing on her, and Jinx retaliates by knocking her out. Silco and Vi each try to convince her to either spare or kill Caitlyn, and in her overwhelm, she shoots and kills Silco. Breaking down at her own actions, she takes fishbones, powered by the hextech gemstone, and fires a missile at the Piltover council; leading to the death of 3 councillors - the most being notable is  Cassandra Kiramman ,  Irius Bolbok  and  Torman Hoskel .
 
 Fate 
 At the end of Season 2, Jinx falls down the Piltovan Hexgate alongside Warwick in an effort to blow him up and sacrifice herself so that Vi can live her life. While this would've killed an average character on the show, there are many indicators that confirm that she did in fact survive.
 Playing this moment frame by frame reveals a pink streak of light that resembles the same trails Jinx leaves whenever she maneuvers whilst activating her powers given to her by the Shimmer that inhabits her blood. In the very final scene, I.E the Epilogue sequence, reveals Caitlyn to be examining the schematics for the Hexgate, more specifically the ventilation system, on her home projector whilst stimming with the hem of the very same monkey bomb that Jinx used to supposedly blow herself up, meaning that Caitlyn personally entered the Hexgate to search for any signs of Jinx and found only the monkey bomb head, further proving that Jinx is alive and must have escaped through an air duct in the nick of time thanks to her Shimmer powers. 
 Another indicator harkens back to right at the beginning of Season 1. In 'Welcome to the Playground', Jinx (Or, at the time, Powder) stands atop a rooftop with her siblings as they watch a blimp fly over their heads. Powder, in awe, exclaims 'One day, I'm gonna fly in one of those things.' Only to be interrupted by Mylo. The very last shot at the end of  'The Dirt Under Your Nails' reveals a blimp of the exact same design to be flying away from presumably Piltover, as well as the fact that the 'THE END' card is presented in Jinx's signature hallucination style, meaning she not only got her wish but used it to permanently leave Piltover and Zaun (More on this in the paragraph below). While we never get to personally see who is actually operating this blimp, it's a safe bet given the previously mentioned factors that Jinx is the person flying it. There was also a cut shot from this final scene in which the camera entered the blimp and showed Jinx operating it, but this shot was cut for the sake of ambiguity.  
 The final hint lies within lines that were spoken earlier on in Season 2. In 'Killing is a Cycle', Jinx hallucinates Silco and has a conversation with him, in which she realises that while killing is what she's known for, it wouldn't solve her problems, and that the only way she can break the cycle of violence is not by trying to end hostility, but by walking away entirely, which is exactly what she soon tells Vi she's going to do. Another noticeable line is when Jinx and Vi reunite in the Hexgate Tower and Jinx tells Vi that she's always with Vi as a sister, even when they're 'worlds apart', further implying that she's leaving Piltover and Zaun.
 
 Characteristics 
 Personality 
 As a little girl, Powder was shy and sweet, but clumsy and prone to making mistakes. This, paired with a case of middle child syndrome, sparked irritation from her older ""brother"" Mylo, who referred to her as a jinx. She greatly admired her older sister Vi (her only biological family) and saw her as a role model and an almost parental figure. While not as physically capable as Vi, she was very creative and spent much of her spare time making different kinds of inventions, mostly bombs and other small explosives. However, they were predictably unreliable and were only effective later in her teens. She showed how skilled she was with a gun, beating her best friend, Ekko, and her brother, Mylo, on various occasions. Despite her general timid, quiet nature, Powder was shown on multiple occasions to have extremely strong emotional reactions, especially when faced with the possibility of abandonment, screaming, and crying with accompanying hallucinations and self-harming behavior, something her character retains later in the series.
 After witnessing the death of her family and her sister's abandonment, Powder adopted the identity of Jinx. Jinx is incredibly mentally unstable and has become unpredictable and remorseless as a teen, showing no mercy towards her opponents or anything she perceives as a threat. She is incredibly smart, both in her combat and her weapon-making abilities. Like her younger self, Jinx has extremely strong emotions, only strengthened by her guilt, which she copes with using violence and often self-harm. Despite her outward appearance of a ""manic pixie nightmare girl"", her innocent, bubbly attitude is a conscious front used to manipulate the people around her. Along with her wild, ruthless nature, we also see her being vulnerable and childlike in her actions, a contrast between Jinx and Powder, who are separate identities (as a result of both her childhood trauma and likely Borderline Personality Disorder), and we see many times where her actions remind us she is a child trapped in the body of a teen. She is left alone to deal with her guilt from the traumatic events leading to the deaths of her brothers and Vander and her resentment towards Vi, who she believes abandoned her, something drilled into her by Silco to cement her loyalty to him. 
 
 Appearance 
 Just below average height, Jinx stands at 5,3 (159-161cm), with a slender, wiry figure. She weighs somewhere between 44-50kg (97-110lbs), making her underweight or very close to it. She has an hourglass figure with a slim waist and wider hips and shoulders.
 Jinx is rather pale, which could be attributed to the lack of sunlight in the lanes, as her skin was rosier when she was Powder. She also has slightly sharp, sickly facial features. There are constant dark circles under her eyes, noticeable tear burns, and dull purple lips. Her eyes are a silvery powder blue with darker flecks. However, they change to a pink/red violet hue due to shimmer that is seen for the first time at the end of  episode 8 . Her eyes briefly change shades depending on which side of her is out, and while witnessing the presumed death of  Isha , her eyes briefly turn their normal color again. 
 Her bright blue hair is styled in two long blue braids with a sharp side bang styled on her left. The braids fall down her back and reach her ankles (approximately 125-150cm); both braids are decorated with bullet casings in both silver and gold and engraved with her drawings. She has a widow's peak and a few short strands of hair hanging loosely around her face.
 Jinx has tattoos on the right side of her body, depicting clouds similar to the ones caused by both the warehouse explosion in  episode 3  and also the flare that is given to her by Vi, which she uses in  episode 6 . The tattoos are drawn in pale blue, with darker blue outlines, and cover her arm, shoulder, and stomach on the right-hand side. After her transformation from the shimmer, the tattoos are faded and scarred from the injection and her body's reaction to the drug.
 Her attire consists of a dark brown leather crop top with a piece of thin off-white cloth running through four eyelets to form an x in the center of her chest. The front and back of the crop top are connected at the base with a thin belt and at the top with a circular neckline that splits into a choker. She wears low-waisted, vertically striped pants in shades of purple/pink, torn unevenly at the bottom and shorter on the right side. She also wears arm warmers, one black and the other black on the upper half, while the lower half matches the pink/purple of her pants. Additionally, she has a studded belt of three individual sections: the one around her waist, the two that loop from the back to connect to the belt on the right side, and the hem of her pants on the left. She also has a pocket on her right hip for explosives and a gun holster on her left. She is seen wearing a large band-aid on her upper left calf, which covers the wound she is seen patching herself with a staple gun in  episode 7 . Finally, she wears a pair of loose, worn combat boots to which she's added magenta laces and extra metal elements on the toes and heels, both silver and gold.
 Jinx is also assumed to be ambidextrous. She prefers to shoot with her left hand but also uses her right hand as a seemingly dominant hand in many other scenes.
 As a child, Powder stood at around 4’3”–4’6” (129–137cm) with softer, more childlike features, a slender body, and wider eyes. Her blue hair was shorter and styled in a single braid that fell just below her shoulders, and roughly chopped, chin-length bangs held in place with a collection of small metal hair clips. Her attire consisted of a dark blue shirt (which seems to be her shirt from when she was a baby presented at the start of  episode 1  over a pink/purple T-shirt with darker vertical stripes (the same fabric as her pants in the later episodes), brown shorts over purple leggings and brown ankle boots. She wears a blue skirt with a wide section in the front, a belt and pockets for bombs and extra parts, and dark arm and leg warmers.
 
 Abilities 
 Accuracy : Jinx is seen to be an excellent shot. She can outshoot Mylo in the training simulator and beat Ekko when the two played together. She tends to prefer handguns such as pistols but is also seen using a type of Gatling gun. 
 Inventions : while she was under the name of Powder, she struggled with building working inventions. As she grew older, she became more adept at inventing weaponry, specifically bombs. It's implied that she made most of the weapons used by Silco's gang. [3] 
 Shimmer Enhanced Physicality : Thanks to the use of Shimmer, Jinx is now far stronger, faster, and more agile than any regular human at the cost of her already shaky mental health. It especially affects her speed, allowing her to use flash step to dodge attacks in battle. 
 Trivia 
 Jinx has an unspecified mental illness and trauma disorder. She feels trapped in a world distorted by her anxieties, which causes her to become irrational, amplified by Silco’s influence.
 Jinx is popularly assumed to suffer from borderline personality disorder (BPD) by the community. BPD is a disorder characterized by a great fear of abandonment, intense and unstable emotions, erratic and impulsive behavior, and paranoia, and it can also lead to psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. 
 Jinx suffers from PTSD from the event that killed her family and her sister abandoning her. Alongside this, she experiences survivor's guilt. These traumas have greatly amplified her struggles and likely are the main cause of her psychosis. 
 Despite the fall and explosion at the end, the series gives several clear hints that she is alive:
 During the explosion, a purple stripe that moves from the explosion to the upper right side of the screen can be spotted. This purple stripe is similar to the effect when Jinx speeds up using Shimmer. When viewing the scene frame-by-frame, it is perfectly visible that this strip starts on the right side of the explosion and continues to move to the upper right side of the screen during a large number of frames. This is not a light effect, because frame-by-frame viewing shows other lighting effects that differ in color palette, as well as appear and disappear in much fewer frames than this purple stripe, which indicates that the source of this purple stripe is a moving physical object, and not a simple flash of purple light. 
 Caitlin can be seen looking at the drawings of the Gate Tower while she holds in her hand the  head from the monkey grenade that Jinx detonated. While looking at the blueprints, Caitlin finds information about the air vents, one of which Jinx most likely escaped through. 
 Next, there is a hint that Jinx has flown out of Zaun. In the last frames, they show exactly the same airship that was shown in episode 1 of season 1. In episode 1 of season 1, Powder said that someday she would fly on the same airship. 
 A small hint is given in the form of a frame with the inscription The End in the art style of Jinx, appearing after the scene with the airship. 
 Jinx' eye color is called Violet Red with HEX code #C71585.

 Biography [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Jules sits beside  Vern  as he conducts a business transaction with Huck, who is upset about not being paid the ten thousand they agreed upon. After Huck's snit tossing the bag of money toward them, Jules pulls out her knife, plunges it into the table, and asks that Huck make a choice.
 They're then joined by  Vander , who, despite Vern asking him to leave, pulls himself a chair and advises Jules to be careful with her words as the bar patrons glare at her. Vern then calls Vander by his name and Jules by his title, ""Hound of the Underworld"". She follows up by saying that she expected someone younger, but Vern claims he'd expect them to respect their deals. This leads to Vander politely asking them to follow up with the deal they made with Huck, and they tacitly agree.
 Upon seeing  Vi  and her group enter the bar, Vander leaves the table.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Jules is a quiet, no-nonsense lady, but when triggered, she's not afraid to act with intimidation.

 Biography [ ] 
 Lest is a character created solely for  Arcane  and does not appear in  League of Legends . Due to her limited screentime, only so much can be derived about her character outside of the fact she has some connection/affiliation with  Mel Medarda . In “Finally Got the Name Right”, she is seen treating  Salo  with  shimmer  in an attempt to heal his legs, before being dismissed by  Ambessa Medarda . 
 Later, she is seen giving Mel the information she overheard from Ambessa and Salo’s meeting, and providing Mel with the tool she needs to succeed before vanishing into thin air. In “ Paint the Town Blue ”, she is seen once again treating Salo with shimmer, where he then lashes out, demanding that he be treated more often. Lest pulls away, informing him of “someone who performs miracles”, obviously referencing  Viktor . 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Lest has limited screentime, but is shown to be a versatile, adaptable woman. She primarily deals in illicit substances to the wealthy movers and shakers of Piltover, smoothly switching between different masks to survive and gain. While she is willing to provide information to Mel about Salo's use of shimmer, she puts her own survival ahead of any political plays, disgusted with the idea of being treated as an expendable pawn.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Lest is a cat-like humanoid with a clothing style inspired by a combination  Romani dress  and  early 20th century western glamor , used to evoke a  fortune teller  archetype. She is easily identified by her large ears, puffy coat, and unique, gravelly voice, as well as digitigrade feet.

 Lest was confirmed to be trans by Eve Lindley, Lest's original English voice actor. [1] [2] [3]

 Season 2 [ ] 
 Act 1 [ ] 
 We first meet Maddie when she introduces herself to Vi after a night of drinking in the street with her new friend, Loris. Vi assumes Maddie is there to be an aggressor but is surprised when Maddie gives her compliments and relays Caitlyn's positive opinions of her. 
 
 Act 2 [ ] 
 Maddie appears in episode 4, Paint the Town Blue, after the intro plays. She is lying in bed with Caitlyn, hinting that they had an intimate moment in the bedroom. She doesn’t have much dialogue after this scene but she does appear again when Caitlyn leaves a lamp in remembrance of her mother and the other deceased council members.
 
 Act 3 [ ] 
 Maddie betrays Caitlyn by joining Ambessa, although the salute she makes is Noxian, hinting she may have been a sleeper agent. Maddie attempts to execute Caitlyn with a rifle shot to the head, expressing some regret at doing so, but Mel deflects the bullet with a barrier spell, hitting Maddie in the head and killing her instead.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Maddie is perpetually optimistic and enthusiastic, radiating warmth and positivity wherever she goes. She is always ready with a smile and encouraging word. Eager to learn and please her superiors, especially Caitlyn. However, her eventual betrayal and the salute she gives Ambessa while doing so hint that she may have been a sleeper agent for Noxus.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Maddie is a young woman, her age never stated, with short choppy orange hair that falls just past her chin, grey-blue eyes, and a spattering of freckles across her nose and cheeks. She has a heart-shaped face with naturally rosy cheeks and a warm smile.  She usually wears her police uniform with pride, but off-duty, in episode 4, is seen in a white unbuttoned blouse.

 History [ ] 
 Marcus had always been overzealous in acting on his duties as an enforcer. He looked down on  Zaunites  in general and aggressively went after them. [2] [3]  When four children from the undercity caused an explosion in  Jayce 's workshop, Marcus joined Sheriff  Grayson  in investigating. They went to see  Vander , with whom Grayson had a deal to maintain the peace between their districts.  [2]  Marcus did not care about their deal; however, when pressured by the  Council , he tried to look for the children on his own, more so when the crime lord  Silco  approached him with a deal.
 Marcus went to  The last Drop  and ordered his men to search the place. Grayson confronted him for this, and though she'd felt it was too late to stop their retaliation, they received the pneumatic tube capsule she'd given Vander when they had someone who would claim responsibility for the explosion. Vander's daughter  Vi  tried to turn herself in,  [3]  only for Vander to stop her and surrender himself in her place. However, before they could return to the upper city, Silco had his  beast  kill Grayson. Silco told them that the terms of their deal had changed and threw him his money.
 Later, Marcus kidnapped Vi. [4]  Silco had expected, and possibly ordered, Marcus to kill her, but he instead threw her into  Stillwater Hold  without a trial or details of her crimes. [5]  Marcus had to bribe the warden on at least one occasion to ensure Vi's stay in the prison. [1] 
 Marcus kept up his dealings with Silco. He was also eventually promoted to Sheriff in their department, making him even more useful to Silco. With his position, Marcus and other enforcers managed to aid Silco's business by letting his shipments through the  Hexgates  go through with no problems. He also interfered when other enforcers tried to investigate Silco's dealings and shut them down. [6] [7]  Marcus also had deals with the merchants in the city, one that most members of the Council secretly sanctioned. [8] 
 He was not without his doubts about his deal with Silco, particularly when Silco's daughter  Jinx  caused the deaths of his officers. Once, he visited Grayson's crypt and remembered Grayson's time as Sheriff and how good the woman had been. Nonetheless, Marcus toed the line between doing right by his men and having to work for Silco, now needing to find someone to answer for the explosion as Silco would be unwilling to give up his daughter. Silco told Marcus to pin the explosion on  the Firelights . For a moment, Marcus considered blowing himself up along with Silco using Jinx's bomb but was ultimately unable to do so. [8] 
 When  Jayce Talis , very recently appointed a Councilor, ordered him to tighten security at the Hexgates, Marcus tried to warn him and advised him to consult the Council first. True enough, Jayce would later need to take this back when he learned from  Mel  that the decision was poorly received. Jayce was unhappy about this, though, and in frustration and hopes of getting ahead of further attacks from—as Marcus relayed—the Firelights, Jayce took his joking suggestion to form a blockade at the bridge and search everyone who would attempt to pass seriously. [5] 
 When  Caitlyn  tried to cross the bridge back to  Piltover , now with evidence against Silco, Marcus threatened to shoot her. He hesitated and was ultimately not given the chance to decide whether he would go through with it or not as  Jinx 's weaponized  firelight bombs  surrounded them and went off. Marcus survived long enough to try and pass on a message to his daughter through Caitlyn but succumbed to his injuries before he could finish his sentence. [9] 
 With this, the Council was finally made aware of his partnership with Silco, though Caitlyn tried to somewhat save his reputation by clarifying that he did it not primarily for what he would gain but for  what  he had to lose. [10] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Marcus is shown to be aggressive towards Zaunites and arrogant towards his peers, especially after his elevation to Sheriff. He often dismisses the concerns of his inferiors, i.e., Caitlyn, and does not hesitate to assert his authority when needed. An example of this is assigning the graveyard shift at the Progress Day festival to Caitlyn when she disobeyed his orders. 
 Although he is depicted as unfeeling and apathetic to people's suffering, he is shown to have a soft spot for his daughter whenever her safety is concerned. Silco uses this weakness to manipulate him by threatening to harm her if Marcus doesn't comply with his orders. Even though he is corrupt, occasionally, he is shown ruminating and regretting his harmful actions—but he never takes action to repent for them.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Marcus is a slim, tall man, perhaps in his mid-thirties or early forties. He is pale-skinned, with short, small, dark brown hair with graying sideburns and a Brett's beard. He has small brown eyes with bags under them and thick eyebrows. He has a big, thick nose and a mustache under it. He is often seen wearing his Enforcer uniform, even at home.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Accuracy : As an Enforcer and Sheriff, it can be assumed that Marcus was a good shooter.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 In her chambers,  Elora  tells Mel that she's now the richest person in  Piltover , and yet she sighs, saying she's the poorest in Medarda. She notes her desire for something fresh and innovative and hears from Elora about the upcoming trial of  Jayce Talis  and his background. [1] 
 Afterward, Mel gives a present to fellow  Piltover Council  member  Torman Hoskel , who loves it. Sometime after Jacye's trial, she listens to a report from  Grayson  and  Marcus  about the culprits still at large who stole from Jayce's workshop. [1] 
 One night, Mel catches Jayce and  Viktor  attempting to break into  Heimerdinger's  lab. The two would be trespassers who try to reason with Mel in their endeavor. Perhaps on a whim, Mel gives them one day to prove they're right and, in the process, averts the attention of the local patroler  Harold . [2] 
 Eventually, Heimerdinger, accompanied by two guards, confronts Viktor and Jayce, who successfully complete their experiment. Although Heimerdinger reprimands the two for their actions, Mel defends them, saying that it's the era of magic, but Jayce corrects her, stating it's the era of Hextech. [2]

 History [ ] 
 With Vi and Claggor, Mylo sometimes went on jobs for Vander since the children were eager to prove themselves and be treated like adults. Mylo often made the younger orphan Powder the target of his irritation, often calling her a jinx for foiling their jobs.
 During one particular trip to  Piltover  to rob a  workshop  on  Ekko 's tip, Powder accidentally caused an explosion that caught the attention of the  enforcers , thus initiating a manhunt for the culprits. With their descriptions closely matching their ragtag group, Vander asked them to lay low, [1]  but still found themselves almost getting caught several times. Vi tried to surrender herself in their stead, [2]  only to be stopped by Vander, who was taken by  Silco  before he could be taken back to the upper city. When Vi told them, Mylo and Claggor insisted on coming with.
 Once at Silco's  Shimmer  factory, Mylo picked the locks on Vander's bindings while Vi faced off against Silco's goons and Claggor made an escape route for them. Before they can escape, however, Powder causes an explosion with the stolen  magic crystals , killing him and Claggor in the ensuing collapse. [3] 
 
 
 
 Mylo and Claggor's deaths continued to haunt Powder for years to come. Powder, who'd started going by Jinx, created dummies that somewhat resembled them. Jinx also manifested them as invisible companions or voices that would often influence her decisions. [4] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Mylo is very confident in himself. This results in him bragging a lot, which  Vi  tells him off about. He also has the tendency to complain or pick fights with the rest of the group. [1] 
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Mylo is a lanky teen of average height for his age with thick scruffy eyebrows, a deep widow's peak, and sloped face, giving him a crow-like appearance. He wears a white sleeveless shirt, leather shoulder pads, baggy pants that cinch above the ankle, and he has bands of twine around his arm.

 Biography [ ] 
 Vi ’s death [ ] 
 When Vi dies, this is where the two universes diverge. Mylo can be seen on the ground, eyes filled with tears as he begings to panic at the sight of his dead sister.
 
 Ekko ’s arrival [ ] 
 When Ekko enters  The last Drop  with  Powder , Mylo and  Claggor  walk up to them and talk. They sit down, but he notices  Gert  working and decides to walk up to her. Claggor tells Powder to go “save him”, as Mylo stutters when trying to catch Gert’s attention. Powder helps him; asking about her next performance (which happened to be the night of the Innovator’s Competition). 
 At said competition, he and Claggor both watch Gert’s performance.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 This Mylo is identically personality wise to the main universe; he is very confident and cracks jokes often. He tends to overstep his confidence, though, as seen when he tries to talk to Gert.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Mylo has a few new additions to his design that includes new facial hair (mustache and sideburns) and a completely new outfit. He wears a green jacket with a large white collar, brown and green vest decorated with golden accents, and a red cloth tied around his neck.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 Refer to  Viktor .
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 In season 1, the Mysterious Mage is seen in  Episode 2  where he rescues a young Jayce and his mother. He is seen to give Jayce a crystal which Jayce carries with him into adulthood, it being a representation of his dream to create  Hextech .
 Jayce is seen to have held this original meeting with the Mysterious Mage as a significant factor in his motive to utilise the  Arcane  via scientific means and to feel strongly about the experience to the extent of defying  Heimerdinger  when requested to abandon the research for fears of corruption.
 
 Season II [ ] 
 In season 2, it is revealed in  Episode 9  that the identity of the Mysterious Mage is that of Viktor, having gone through parallel universes to give Jayce the crystal. It is shown in these universes that the appearance of the crystal changes in each iteration, implying a possible differing outcomes to each. The timeline followed by the show is implied to be the timeline where Jayce succeeds in preventing Viktor's observed outcome of the Glorious Evolution and its consequences, thus fulfilling a promise he made to him in the alternate timeline seen in  Episode 7. 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Contrary to how Viktor is seen in Act III, the Mysterious Mage is seen to be saddened by the outcome of his intertwinement with the  Hexcore  and the  Arcane . He appears relieved to see Jayce and has a desire to prevent the outcome of the Glorious Evolution his past self was devoted to.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 The Mysterious Mage appears as an older, bearded Viktor. He wears a hooded robe and carries a staff. His hair appears longer and his eyes shift in colour as his earlier self's does, indicating a connection remains between him and the Arcane. In addition, the metallic-like effect on the sides of his face remain, although, he distinctly lacks the changes in his body seen at the beginning of season 2 caused by being encased by the Hexcore.
 
 Powers and Abilities [ ] 
 Control over the Arcane.
 
 Trivia [ ] 
 The butterfly often seen in relation to Viktor is shown in  Season 1 Episode 2,  foreshadowing the reveal. 
 Viktor appears to have repeated the act of giving Jayce the crystal in seemingly all timelines, as implied in  Season 2 Episode 9 's dialogue.

 The  City of Piltover Police Department  is the law enforcement agency in  Piltover .
 The Department presumably has a number of departments and ranks under it. Their duties range from investigating and arresting criminals (under the Piltover Enforcer Department), [1]  patrolling  Zaun  and Piltover's streets, as well as the Academy and Council building, [2]  watching over events in the city and their high-ranking officials, [3]  serving as prisonguards of  Stillwater Hold  (under the Piltover Department of Corrections), [4]  guarding the ports and inspecting shipments, [3] [5]  enforcing orders and laws as imposed by  Councilors , [6] [7]  among many others.

 Relations with Zaun [ ] 
 Though enforcers are meant to be protectors of both Piltover and Zaun, there is some level of animosity between enforcers and Zaunites — Zaunites tend to fear enforcers as the latter are often inclined to be violent and unfair in treatment towards them, while enforcers have some level of fear about stepping into the undercity.
 For decades, however, in efforts to maintain a semblance of peace, Sheriff  Grayson  made a deal with  Vander  where she would ensure that the enforcers would not meddle too much in Zaun business if Vander kept the Zaunites in check and kept Zaunite chaos out of Piltover's streets. Upon their deaths, this deal was replaced with the later new Sheriff  Marcus ' deal with  Silco , though this new deal was corrupt and for the benefit of both parties instead of the citizens' benefit.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 Powder was born to Felicia and Connol, the younger sister of Violet, better known as Vi. Growing up Powder had a good relationship with Vi, her sister, and her parents. However, when her parents died during a battle on the bridge between Piltover and Zaun, she and Vi were the only people left in their family. After the battle, Vander found the two siblings; he adopted them and raised them as his own, alongside Mylo and Claggor.
 
 Vi's Death [ ] 
 In this reality, Vi died in Powder's arms during the break-in at Jayce's lab, from a hexcrystal explosion. This event appears to be where the timelines branched. 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Powder is lively and bubbly, showing great care for her family. She’s taken the role of the caretaker of her siblings and developed a romantic relationship with Ekko. Vander has a talk with her (apparently one of many) where he tells her “you’re too smart to be in bar all your life” and insinuates that her family is holding her back. Powder is happy where she is. She shows the same talent of being an inventor as she did as a child, and seems gentle and caring. She mourns her sister and has a small memorial in her laboratory, including a small doll that looks like Vi. She handles the grief well despite her pain, and talks to her sister often.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Powder has fair skin, blue eyes and blue hair with a pink streak on the left side, seemingly in honour of her sister, Vi. She has thick bangs and typically wears her hair up in two small space buns. When down, her hair reaches her shoulders. Her makeup is natural and light. She typically paints her nails light blue but alternates to all purple at the party. She wears a choker necklace as well as Vi’s necklace,She still has a blue cloud tattoo on the right side of her abdomen although it is hidden. .
 At the party, She wears vibrant blue and pink eye makeup along with a jacket and dress with 2 piercings in the left ear. 
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Trivia [ ] 
 Powder shows no sign of mental illness. 
 Powder's secret laboratory is the same location as Jinx's hideout. 
 
 Powder secretly kept a stash of unrefined hex crystals in Vi's shrine.

 History [ ] 
 Along with the other most notorious crime lords of Zaun, Renni became part of the group of  chem-barons  that secretly controlled the undercity, led by  Silco .
 At one point, Renni came to require a  green substance  to constantly be delivered through her nose, for which she wore a suit that holds the conduits for the substance. [1] 
 Renni's side of their businesses involved abducting Zaunite children to experiment on. When an  enforcer  happened upon one of their laboratories, the enforcers were able to interrogate one of their victims and was able to at least identify the person running things as a woman who wore a suit. At least one found evidence at the scene—an experimental  suit —had her name on it as the intended user.  Marcus , due to the then Captain of the enforcers' partnership with Silco, was able to halt the release of information and further investigation on her illicit activities. Another enforcer,  Caitlyn Kiramman , found the records of this and kept it as part of an ongoing investigation on  the underground's then unknown ruler  and his  mole  in Piltover. [2] 
 After the actions of Silco's adoptive daughter  Jinx  caused the closure of the borders to Piltover, Renni and the other chem-barons' businesses were affected. They called a meeting to discuss their next action, during which  Finn  tried to convince them to stand their ground against Silco and his unwillingness to stop Jinx's antics. Before they could discuss further, Silco arrived and unleashed a toxic gas in the air before giving them gas masks, reminding them of the insufferable past he'd saved them from. [1] 
 During an unexpected raid on one of their  Shimmer  factories, Renni's son, who was working at the factory and had been the one to sound the building's alarms, was accidentally killed by  Jayce Talis . [3]  When Renni arrived, she demanded justice from Silco; when the latter told her that her son died fighting for the cause, she called him out for the hypocrisy, being unwilling to similarly sacrifice his own  daughter .
 Following this incident, Renni fully allied with Finn and his plans of overthrowing Silco for control over the undercity once and for all. He joined Finn in confronting him, accompanied by  Sevika  whom they believed had been turned, only for the latter to kill Finn. Silco told her that if her son hadn't already been killed, he would have ordered it now for her betrayal. Silco then allowed her to leave. [4]

 Early life [ ] 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 He is quite stoic, always appearing as really calm and in control, even in situation of stress. He is infinitely loyal to Ambessa and doesn’t hesitate to torture, kill and incapacitate for their cause. 
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Rictus is big, towering even over Ambessa who already dwarfs most people. He has mohawk style hairs and a quite substantial brown mustache and beard. He wears other decorum on his face, like a tattoo between his eyes, a stub above his right eye and under his mouth, and black eyeliner under his eyes. 
 He wears the common Noxian Soldier garb and armor, without the helmet, just upsized for his own stature.
 
 Powers and Abilities [ ] 
 • Physically Strongest Human:  He was able to counteract a spell place upon him with raw moght alone, long enough for him to negate it with his weapon. He is capable of easily strangling Caitlyn, a trained enforcer and can easily lift people off the ground with one hand. More impressively, he can easily body slam and overpower Jinx, someone who always benefits from the effects of Shimmer due to it flowing in her veins.
 • Extremly Fast:  He was able to react to Jinx’s pistol while it was travelling towards him, moving fast enough to block it with his weapon. He was then able to somewhat match Jinx in speed, someone who heavily relies on speed in close combat. 
 • Extremely Skilled in Martial Combat:  He can easily take down those who stand in his way with his bare hands alone. On top of that, he is potent with his polearm weapon, being able to use different defensive moves in reaction to opposing attacks, even fighting a close quarter fight with a heavy polearm weapon, attesting to his skill at-arm.
 • Great Endurance:  He took a direct off-guard hit from Warwick and was still conscious enough afterward to reach for his weapon.
 
 Weapons 
 • Glaive : The polearm weapon he seemingly wears as hi primary one. The pole is outfitted with multiple runic talisman’s. These talisman are able to negate magic like the Thorn Magic, and even Hextech is no match for it’s defensive capability. 
 • Fist : F*ck it, We Ball.
 • Armor : His armour looks heavier and more sturdy than those of the enforcers.

 Rio is a pivotal yet enigmatic creature featured in  Arcane , whose biological properties are central to the creation of Shimmer. Rio plays an essential role in  Singed ’s experiments, representing the intersection of nature and science, as well as the ethical boundaries Singed is willing to cross in his pursuit of knowledge.

 2.1   Moral Implications 
 2.2   Tragic Fate 
 
 
 
 
 Appearance and Abilities [ ] 
 Rio is a unique, rare creature that possesses remarkable regenerative abilities. In  Arcane , it is shown as a large, mutated animal, heavily resembling an Axolotl, with incredible healing powers. Rio's regenerative capabilities are vital to  Singed ’s research. The creature can rapidly heal wounds and recover from injuries that would typically be fatal to other beings. Singed's experiments aim to extract and harness this regenerative property, with the ultimate goal of using it to create Shimmer—a drug that could grant enhanced strength, speed, and resilience to its users.
 
 Role in Shimmer’s Creation [ ] 
 Singed’s use of Rio is crucial in the development of  Shimmer . The creature's regenerative essence provides the foundational biological material needed to create the drug. Singed essentially exploits Rio’s extraordinary ability to heal itself to unlock the secrets of human enhancement. This exploitation is central to Singed’s worldview: to achieve his scientific breakthroughs, he is willing to sacrifice innocent life, treating Rio as just another tool in his ruthless pursuit of progress.
 
 Moral Implications [ ] 
 Rio’s involvement in the creation of Shimmer highlights the ethical dilemma at the heart of Singed’s character. He treats the creature as an expendable resource, using its regenerative capabilities without regard for the suffering it endures. In the series, there’s a sense of tragedy surrounding Rio’s fate, as it becomes a test subject in Singed’s dark experiments. The creature's role symbolizes the cost of unchecked scientific ambition—the exploitation of life for the sake of discovery.
 
 Tragic Fate [ ] 
 Despite Rio’s unique regenerative powers, its eventual fate is tragic. Singed’s experiments push the creature beyond its limits, with the creature showing signs of pain and exhaustion as its body is continuously subjected to Singed’s harsh testing. While Rio’s role is critical in the creation of Shimmer, it also serves as a symbol of the broader theme in  Arcane —the sacrifice of the innocent in the name of power and progress.
 In conclusion,  Rio  is not just a biological subject in Singed’s experiments but also a tragic figure within the narrative of  Arcane . Its involvement in the creation of Shimmer reflects the moral corruption of Singed’s scientific pursuits and the costs associated with his relentless quest for knowledge.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Awaiting the trial for  Jayce Talis  in the  Piltover Council  chamber, Salo eats from a bag of nuts, overhearing the conversations that occur there. Overhearing that it was  Torman Hoskel 's birthday, he hastily tried to give him the bag of nuts he was eating, but Torman lashed out at him because he had a nut allergy. [1] 
 During the trial, Salo disparages the academy for lowering its standards. When a vote is to be held for Jayce's sentencing to be expelled from the academy, Salo doesn't vote in favor of it. [1] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Salo is a posh and snappy man. He does not hide his opinions in council sessions, nor in other places. He is bold in his approach towards politics as well. 
 Later, when Viktor ""heals"" him from his Shimmer addiction, he becomes just like all of the other commune members: sympathetic and kind.

 Biography [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Sitting at a table in the bar of  The Last Drop , Sevika proposes they strike back at the people of  Piltover , and everyone else in the bar yells in agreement. However,  Vander  voices in opposition, citing the dangers of what would happen if they retaliate. Disappointed in Vander's logic, she notes while he doesn't look afraid, he looks weak. She then takes her men out of the bar. [1] 
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Sevika and Jinx led the rebellious Zaunites against the invading Piltover enforcers. Later, she also participated in the fight against Ambessa's forces.
 At the end of the season, she was last seen as one of the new Piltover Council members.

 In Season One her top hair is pulled back into a small ponytail with the bottom half hanging down. She wears a black and brown long sleeved vest with gold adornments. Her main feature is her mechanical left arm; which consists of teal and bronze metal that utilizes a shimmer pump at the shoulder blade to enhance her strength.
 In Season Two her new arm consists of a slot machine-like feature that decides what action the arm will pull (chomping, flame-thrower, and more). The arm has a large claw at the end decorated with pink and blue doodles.
 Later on in Season 2, she cuts her hair to a short middle cut.

 Shimmer 
 
 
 

Shimmer was developed by  Singed , Zaun's infamous mad chemist, through a series of cruel and unethical experiments. His goal was to create a substance that could provide strength and power to  Zaun 's oppressed citizens, especially in the face of Piltover’s dominance. To achieve this, Singed drew upon various biological experiments, including the use of a unique creature named  Rio , a rare animal with regenerative properties. Singed attempted to harness Rio's biological essence to unlock the secrets of human enhancement, ultimately extracting its regenerative capabilities to create Shimmer. Through these experiments, Singed sought to find a way to permanently enhance the human body and mind, believing that such power could change the course of Zaun’s future.
 However, Shimmer’s creation was far from perfect. While the drug grants its users increased physical abilities and resilience, it comes with a steep price. Prolonged use leads to severe physical and mental deterioration, with users becoming addicted to its effects. Their bodies eventually break down, and their minds become unstable, leading to madness, violence, and death.
 
 Effects [ ] 
 The immediate effects of Shimmer are highly seductive—enhanced strength, speed, and endurance. Users become superhuman, capable of feats that would otherwise be impossible. However, this comes at the cost of their long-term health. Over time, Shimmer erodes the mind and body, leaving users physically deformed and mentally impaired. As the addiction worsens, users become more erratic and uncontrollable, leading to a vicious cycle of dependency.
 
 Connection to Silco [ ] 
 In  Arcane , Shimmer plays a central role in  Silco's  rise to power. He uses the drug to bolster his control over Zaun, distributing it to his followers and turning them into his loyal, enhanced enforcers. The drug is a means of maintaining power and loyalty, but it also becomes a symbol of the dangerous path Silco is willing to take in order to secure his vision for Zaun’s independence. Shimmer, as a tool of oppression, creates a cycle of addiction and violence that fuels the conflict in Zaun.
 
 Ethical Dilemmas and Consequences [ ] 
 Shimmer exemplifies the darker side of Zaun’s scientific and industrial exploitation. Singed’s creation of Shimmer, though rooted in his desire to transcend the limitations of human biology, highlights the moral decay that accompanies the pursuit of unchecked scientific progress. It serves as a metaphor for the dangerous consequences of playing with nature and human lives, a theme explored throughout  Arcane .
 In summary,  Shimmer  is a substance that symbolizes the corrupting influence of power, greed, and unchecked ambition. It offers temporary strength at a great cost, both to its users and the society that relies on it."

 Biography [ ] 
 History [ ] 
 In their youth, Vander and Silco formed a strong, brotherly bond over their shared dreams for  Zaun 's freedom and unity as one nation. At one point, however, the two had a falling out, after which Vander tried to drown Silco in a river. Due to an open gash on his left eye and the pollution in the river, this eye was contaminated and permanently disfigured. By briefly faking his death, Silco swiped Vander's dagger, stabbed him in the arm, and fled.
 Silco went into hiding, amassing followers and avoiding crossing paths with Vander for years to come. Despite their last encounter, Silco still respected Vander for their time together until he found out about Vander's deal with  enforcers  that kept Zaun in check but in relative peace from upper city interference, a decision Silco strongly resented.

 At one point, Silco had a group of Zaunites led by  Deckard  tail Vander's adoptive children. He'd given the boy instructions not to interfere, which the boy defied by brawling with them and trying to steal their loot, gaining the attention of Vander and  Benzo . Though frustrated, he was appeased when Deckard told him that the children were responsible for the explosion in Piltover earlier that day. After dismissing the boy,  Singed  showed Silco his latest, fairly effective batch of  Shimmer . [2] 
 Seeing an opportunity in the trouble the children caused, Silco decided to move up the timeline of his plans. Frustrated at the boy, Silco decided to make Deckard the first human to test Singed's Shimmer, though Silco could easily convince him. He also contacted Marcus, one of the enforcers investigating the children's case. He made a deal with him. [3]  Silco didn't tell him the whole picture, however, and surprised the enforcer when he had the  Sheriff  killed, telling him about the change of his terms only after the fact and right as he handed him his money. Silco then took Vander from his custody and took him to his Shimmer factory. [1]

 Silco went to a statue of Vander, pondering his current situation where he'd found himself in the same position that Vander himself had been in—stuck with a choice between a chance at Zaun's independence and his daughter's safety. Vander's decision had been one Silco held against him for years. Still, one Silco found himself about to make, telling Vander's image that he understood now. Jinx was listening in, unbeknownst to him, and mistakenly assumed that Silco would give her up to the upper city. With this, Jinx knocked him out and took him to the place where it all started: Silco's old Shimmer factory at the cannery. She tied him to a dining chair and later returned with  Vi . [9]

 Personality [ ] 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Abilities [ ] 
 High Intelligence :  Silco is able to lead an entire criminal empire and to stay out of sight of the authorities, thanks to elaborated corruption and tricks, showing that he is capable of great cunning. 
 Leader :  Thanks to his intelligence, ideology and scare tactics, Silco was respected and feared in Zaun. A lot of people, including Sevika, left Vander's side to join him. He was also able to rule on the Lanes and the Chembarons during the seven-year timeskip. 
 Fighting :  Although he is not physically impressive, Silco has shown in his two duels against Vander that he was able to be fast and vicious. He seems particularly good at handling a knife. 
 Stamina :  Due to his past as a miner, Silco seems quite resistant to pain and is accustomed to the Underground's toxic gasses. Where his subordinates cannot breathe it, he seems almost immune to it. 
 Trivia [ ] 
 After the show's release, it was announced that Silco would be added to  Riot Games '  Teamfight Tactics  as part of the upcoming  Gizmos & Gadgets  mid-set. [10] [11] 
 In Ekko's alternate universe, Silco's scars are much better healed, probably because he undergoes less stress, due to the fact that he is not a crime lord in this version.

 Biography [ ] 
 Singed , also known as the ""Mad Chemist,"" is a brilliant yet enigmatic scientist in  Arcane . Hailing from  Zaun , he operates on the fringes of morality, pushing the boundaries of science regardless of the consequences. His relentless pursuit of knowledge and innovation defines him as both a genius and a harbinger of destruction.
 Singed plays a critical role in the creation of  Shimmer , the highly potent and addictive substance that grants its users extraordinary strength and resilience. To develop this chemical, Singed experiments extensively, using test subjects ranging from humans to exotic creatures. His fascination with evolution and biology leads him to use a creature named  Rio , a rare animal with regenerative abilities. Singed attempts to harness Rio's biological properties to unlock the secrets of life and transformation, sacrificing the creature's health in the process. This obsession underscores his belief that progress requires great sacrifice—a theme that defines his character.
 In his lab, Singed is shown with a  Two-headed Creature , another experimental subject. This creature symbolizes his disregard for natural boundaries, as he manipulates lifeforms to serve his scientific ambitions. While the exact purpose of this experiment remains unclear, it demonstrates Singed's willingness to tamper with the very fabric of life to achieve his goals.
 Singed's partnership with  Silco  stems from their shared vision of empowering Zaun, albeit through destructive means. He supplies Silco with Shimmer, which becomes a cornerstone of Silco’s rise to power. However, Singed’s motivations go beyond loyalty; he views his work as a necessary path to greater understanding, even if it brings chaos to Zaun.
 Singed’s character is tinged with tragedy. A photograph in his lab hints at a lost loved one—possibly a daughter—who might have inspired his obsession with preserving and enhancing life. This loss adds depth to his otherwise cold and calculating demeanor, suggesting that his unyielding drive stems from deeply personal pain.
 In  Arcane , Singed is a figure of shadows and complexity, whose experiments shape the fates of countless lives in Zaun. He is neither wholly villain nor hero, but a man consumed by his vision of progress, willing to destroy in order to create.

 Biography [ ] 
 Little is known of Sky's childhood or adult life. It can be assumed that at some point in her early childhood she lived in the same area of  Zaun  as Viktor—she can be seen in a flashback to Viktor’s childhood, where she appears in a group of children playing in a stream. [1] 
 By Acts 2 and 3 of Season 1, Sky has become  Jayce and Viktor’s assistant, and can be seen helping Jayce prepare for his Progress Day speech in Episode Four. While walking past Viktor, Sky clutches her books closer to her chest and avoids Viktor's eye contact, smiling to herself. 
 
In a bid to further her relationship with Viktor, Sky nervously asks him to walk home with her from the laboratory. However, Viktor, obsessing over the Hexcore, remains oblivious to Sky's affection, and shortly denies her request. Sky gently chides Viktor for overworking himself, reminding him; There’s always tomorrow… right?
—Sky Young Well, not for Sky. Soon after this interaction, she decides to attempt talking to Viktor again. She can be heard confessing her admiration for Viktor in a practice speech while walking towards the door of their laboratory. Upon entering the room, she finds Viktor, covered in carved runes, with his hand sealed to the glowing, sputtering Hexcore. In a desperate and instinctive act to save his life, Sky rushed over and clings to Viktor, attempting to pull him away from the Hexcore - and being vaporized in the process.
 Once Viktor regains consciousness, he finds little left of Sky other than a teal journal, a jacket, and her half-moon glasses. 
 Overcome with guilt, Viktor scatters her ashes over the stream they used to play in as children.  
 Sky was reincarnated inside the Hexcore during Season 2, and she became Viktor’s assistant once again. She was mainly seen by his side supporting his many trials and tribulations, however, after Jayce destroyed Viktor’s physical body, she disappeared from the Hexcore.  
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 As we never saw Sky outside of Viktor's presence, it's difficult to gauge what her countenance might have been—but while around Viktor, Sky was shy, quiet and nervous. She had a slouched posture and a tendency to evade eye contact, suggesting a lack of confidence.
 However, through her journal we learn that Sky was also an incredibly kind, empathetic and altruistic person. She was deeply inspired by Viktor's own desire to help the people of his city, leading her to pursue a career that would ultimately allow her to help as many people as possible. 
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Sky had light brown skin, light brown eyes, and chestnut brown hair pulled back in a high ponytail. She had freckles across her cheeks, and wore half moon glasses. She wore the Academy colours of a white blazer, a red shirt, cropped navy trousers, and light grey and white shoes.

 In her Astral Form, Sky does not need her glasses.

 History [ ] 
 At one point, Smeech became part of the group of crime lords that control the undercity led by  Silco . [1] 
 Smeech once had a problem with someone from the Lanes who was unable to pay back his debt to him. Smeech sent him a signed note and a warning to not go to his compatriots and made a joke about the man's amputated leg. He then had his henchman break into the man's warehouse to go through the man's things and presumably steal what was believed by the investigators to be a stash of medical equipment. Because the target confronted his docile but strong lackey, the man was killed, with part of the encounter seen by a witness, and became the subject of a homicide investigation.
 Because of Silco having the  Sheriff  in his pocket, and because of the witness' fear of repurcussion from the  chem-barons , the investigation became an unsolved, cold case. Another enforcer,  Caitlyn Kiramman , found the records of this and kept it as part of an ongoing investigation on  the underground's then unknown ruler  and his  mole  in Piltover. Caitlyn momentarily believed that the ringleader ""S"" was Smeech before one of their interviewees made it clear that he wasn't, discriminating against Smeech for being a  yordle . [2] 
 After the actions of Silco's adoptive daughter  Jinx  caused the closure of the borders to Piltover, the chem-barons' businesses were affected. They called a meeting to discuss their next action, during which  Finn  tried to convince them to stand their ground against Silco and his unwillingness to stop Jinx's antics. Before they could discuss further, Silco arrived and released a toxic gas in the air before giving them gas masks, reminding them of the insufferable past he'd saved them from. [1] 
 At the beginning of Act 2, Smeech and his goons decided to capture Jinx. However, he was ambushed by Sevika and Isha, where the former killed Smeech with her newfound mechanical arm.

 Hexcore : The Catalyst of Creation and Destruction [ ] 
 The Hexcore is a groundbreaking yet perilous invention in  Arcane , representing the collision of science, magic, and unchecked ambition. Created by  Jayce  and  Viktor , it epitomizes the potential to transcend natural limits while carrying the seeds of its own destruction. The Hexcore’s influence extends beyond mere technology, as it becomes a key driver in shaping the destinies of Piltover and Zaun—for better and for worse.
 
 Creation and Features [ ] 
 The Hexcore was developed in Piltover during Viktor and Jayce’s collaboration to push hextech’s boundaries. By combining hextech crystals with organic materials, the Hexcore became a sentient and adaptive entity, capable of:
 
 Rewriting Biology : It could heal injuries, enhance physical abilities, and transcend mortal limitations. 
 Powering Evolution : The Hexcore evolved alongside its users, responding to their desires but often at a devastating cost. 
 Unpredictable Sentience : Its ability to act autonomously made it powerful but highly dangerous. 
 A Vision of Hope and Ruin [ ] 
 For Viktor, the Hexcore was a beacon of hope. He saw it as a solution to uplift Zaun’s oppressed people, granting them the ability to overcome sickness, poverty, and inequality. For  Jayce , it represented the possibilities of technological innovation but also a growing concern over its instability. The device’s ability to enhance life was quickly overshadowed by its darker tendencies—demanding sacrifices, corrupting its users, and unraveling the balance between science and humanity.
 
 Jayce’s Time Travel Vision [ ] 
 In a pivotal moment, Jayce is granted a vision of the future—a timeline where the Hexcore’s unchecked power leads to catastrophic consequences. He sees a world where the Hexcore, once a symbol of progress, has become a weapon of unparalleled destruction.
 
 Piltover’s Downfall : The Hexcore’s volatile nature causes catastrophic explosions, destroying much of Piltover’s infrastructure and plunging its citizens into chaos. 
 Zaun’s Corruption : While initially benefiting from the Hexcore’s enhancements, Zaun becomes consumed by the substance's toxic influence, turning its people into mutated husks, enslaved by its power. 
 Fractured Societies : The vision highlights how the Hexcore exacerbates the divide between Piltover and Zaun, fueling violence, distrust, and ultimately the collapse of both cities. 
 This haunting vision serves as a warning to Jayce of the potential destruction that unbridled ambition and reckless innovation can bring. It forces him to confront the ethical responsibilities of their creation and question whether the Hexcore should ever exist.
 
 Impact on  Arcane [ ] 
 The Hexcore’s story reflects the central themes of  Arcane : ambition, sacrifice, and the duality of progress. While it offers a glimpse of a brighter future, its unchecked power leads to devastation, as seen in Jayce’s vision. The Hexcore becomes a cautionary tale, embodying the dangers of scientific discovery without ethical boundaries.
 In the end, the Hexcore is both a savior and destroyer—capable of transforming the world but equally capable of tearing it apart. Its legacy shapes the fate of Piltover and Zaun, leaving a mark on the lives of its creators and the world they sought to change."

 When did you get so comfortable living in someone else's shadow?
 
 Vi  to Vander, "" Welcome to the Playground "" 
 Warwick  (born  Vander ) was once the unspoken leader and protector of  the undercity . Determined and zealous, Vander did all he could in his later life to ensure the safety of those under his protection—the residents of Zaun and, more specifically, the four children he'd taken under his wing. When a series of events forces him to choose between an established truce between Zaun and  Piltover  and his children, Vander's life is turned on its head by his past.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 In his youth, Vander formed a strong sibling like bond with two other  Zaun ite individuals,  Silco  and  Felicia , with him and Silco sharing dreams of Zaun's freedom and unity as one nation. At one point, however, the two had a falling out, after which Vander tried to drown Silco in a river, only for the latter to slice his arm to escape. [2] 
 Vander would come to earn the nickname ""Hound of the Underground"", who fought for the community he'd supposedly built and united. He tried to lead a revolt across the bridge to Piltover, one that ended in failure and resulted in multiple deaths, including those of  Felicia and Connol [3]  Upon seeing their bodies, Vander dropped his gauntlets, symbolically abandoning his fight against Piltover, [2]  and took their children  Vi  and  Powder  in. Eventually, he also came to adopt two other children:  Mylo  and  Claggor , all of whom grew up eager to please and to prove themselves to Vander and those around them. [4] 
 In hopes of establishing some semblance of peace in Zaun for their protection, Vander struck a deal with the  Enforcers , mainly their Sheriff,  Grayson —he would ensure that Zaunites would not cause trouble in the upper city, and the enforcers will stay out of his business. [4]  This news would somehow reach Silco, who despised this decision. [2] 
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 One day, his children decided to go topside to try to pull off a heist on their own. The attempt caught the attention of the  Council  and the authorities because it caused an explosion in the Academy district, and the workshop they'd broken into belonged to an  influential family . Even Vander's connection to the  Enforcers  and the leniency of  Sheriff Grayson  could not protect them, though Grayson at least asked for one culprit to take responsibility so that they could present a culprit to the Council. [4] 
 Vander had to talk the children down, particularly Vi, from making more of a scene. This proved challenging due to the continued pressure on the enforcers from the Council and the children's tendency for trouble. After a conversation with Vi, during which he reminded her of the risks fighting Piltover posed, [3]  Vi stole the pneumatic tube capsule from Vander and sent a message to Grayson so she could surrender herself to spare the others. Vander caught on, stopped, and trapped Vi in  Benzo 's basement while he turned himself in instead.
 Before he could be taken to the upper city, they were intercepted by Silco and a  beast on Shimmer  who, after killing Grayson and Benzo, dragged Vander to Silco’s  Shimmer  factory. Silco finally confronted him for their last encounter before he strapped Vander to a chair in preparation for an experiment for  Singed . Vi, Claggor, and Mylo then arrived to break him out. Moments away from escaping, multiple explosions caused by  Powder  rock the cannery, and Vander fights back against Silco's remaining men and the beast before getting stabbed by Silco. Desperate to protect Vi, Vander used the last of his strength to take Shimmer, temporarily turning himself into a monstrous beast. Vander then grabbed Vi and jumped out of the collapsing building, apparently dying from the fall. [2] 
 However, as revealed in episode 9, Singed found Vander's body and took it back to his lab, where he began experimenting on him.
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Vander, now Warwick, has been transformed into a wolf-like beast by Singed. Vander retains little of his humanity as he becomes instinctual, bloodthirsty, and animalistic. He is then released and rampages the prison that Jinx and Sevika are inside, freeing Zaunite prisoners that were arrested unlawfully; one of these prisoners being Isha. Warwick continues the spree, killing any guard and prisoner in his way until finally getting to Jinx, Sevika, Isha, and the Enforcers who were preparing to arrest them. The Enforcers turn their focus to Warwick, attempting and failing to stop him as Jinx haphazardly prepares her weapons. Jinx would tell Sevika to run and get Isha away as she prepares the fight the beast head on. 
 Jinx ends up getting pinned to the wall, Warwick ready to tear her apart until pausing. Flashes of Powder begin to cloud his eyes as he stares at Jinx, remembering the scared little girl he took in as his own daughter. This seemed to calm the beast, as Warwick’s breathing steadied, presumably allowing Jinx to slip away.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Vander is implied to have been a brutal man in his younger years. A flashback reveals an incident between him and Silco, where Vander tried to viciously drown the latter in Zaun’s polluted river, despite carrying a knife with him. After leading a failed uprising against Piltover's regime that saw a tragic loss of life, Vander was forced to bear the message to Vi and Powder that their parents had lost their lives in the fighting. After witnessing the grief this bore upon the two children, Vander turned pacifist, dropping his weapons and carrying the girls away to raise them as their father.
 At the time of Arcane's first act, Vander was the surrogate father of Vi, Powder, Mylo, and Claggor. A caring man, Vander was always willing to protect those who needed his help. He was seen as a protector by many, and he cared for the Lanes and the people in them. He governed the Lanes through paternal authority, relying on people's gratitude and genuine respect for him to maintain order. Even though he had turned pacifist, he defied his dogma in Episode 3, fighting and seemingly dying to save Vi's life.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Vander was a large, muscular middle-aged man with grey eyes, dark hair, and a neatly trimmed, graying beard. He was generally seen wearing blue trousers, leather boots, a brown leather jacket over a white undershirt, and a leather pauldron on his upper right arm to cover up the scar he got from Silco when he was younger. 
 When Vander uses Shimmer as a last resort to save Vi, it dramatically increases his muscle mass, makes him grow several feet in height, and makes his veins purple and pop out all over his body. The drug also makes him lose some of his cognitive abilities, as he was seen acting more animalistic while under the effects of Shimmer. 
 In his transformed state as Warwick, he has an unnaturally muscular and enlarged body with dark grey fur coating his back, head, and arms. He has metal fans and bolts scattered across body, as well as a central pump filled with a green liquid on his back. His hands are metal gauntlets with sharp claws as fingers. Vander’s face has wolf-like features with pointy ears, wolf nose, and a smaller muzzle-like mouth with sharp teeth. He has dark grey hair and a beard which connects to the fur on his back. In this form; his sclera is black, his right iris is blue, and his left iris is yellowish-green.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Brawler:  Vander had a gift for hand-to-hand combat and was shown to dominate most fights he ever got involved in, even against Shimmer-enhanced opponents. He also taught Vi how to punch, a notable feat considering how skilled Vi became at boxing in her teenage years. 
 Barkeep:  As the owner of The Last Drop, Vander was a skilled bartender and could make various kinds of drinks. 
 Leader:  Vander was a competent and honorable leader despite his past failings, and many Zaunites respected him for it, even after he supposedly died. 
 Teacher:  As the adoptive father of four children, Vander would be their primary teacher in life and gave them just about every skill they needed to survive in Zaun. Even after his assumed death, his lessons would still resonate with Vi and Powder, as displayed when Vi had a hallucination of him encouraging her to work on her guard and get back up during her second fight with Sevika. 
 Trivia [ ] 
 Vander was widely theorized to be the  League of Legends  champion  Warwick , [5] [6]  which was confirmed in the  final episode  of  season 1 . Further shown in  Arcane: Season 2 First Look . 
 Vander and  Loris  have similar appearances, and Vi mistook Loris for Vander in the series finale.

 Biography [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Sitting in a dimly lit corner beside his associate,  Jules ;  Vern  pays  Huck , who brings a couple of mugs of beer to the table. After Huck inspects the bag's contents, he notes that the amount isn't the ten thousand of what they agreed upon; however, Verne claims that is the price for business. Growing upset, Huck lasses out about not being paid the promised amount, and Jules gives him two choices.
 Just then,  Vander  arrives and asks if they need any help, and Vern promptly asks that he leave them. However, Vander refuses, and after taking a seat at the table as the bar patrons look at the two in scorn, Vern calls Vander by his name and Jules by his title. Vander would then politely force the two to honor their deal with Huck, with whom they tacitly agree.
 After seeing the arrival of  Vi  and her companions enter the bar, Vander takes his leave.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 Violet was born in  Zaun  to Felicia and Connol, later having a younger sister, Powder, who she was very close to. When  Vander  led a rebellion against Piltover, her parents were killed in battle, and Vander took the sisters in. Vander later adopted two orphan boys as well, and Vi became the leader of their group.
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Act 1 
 Vi lead her siblings ( Powder ,  Mylo  and  Claggor ) to  topside  for a job. They use the roofs of Piltover to climb to the  room  where there are supposed to be valuables. They easily break in, but the workshop blows up when Powder accidentally drops an unstable  crystal . Before they get underground, they are stopped by  a young man , who asks them if they have a good loot. Mylo answers in the affirmative, and a fight breaks out; Powder is given the bag with valuables and, at some point, runs away. They emerge victorious, but Powder throws the valuables they stole into the water by accident.
 Defeated, they return  home , where Vander awaits them. Vi initially tries to deny she and the others have anything to do with the explosion on topside, but the truth comes out fast. Vander leaves to deal with the aftermath of their actions. Mylo is blaming Powder for losing their loot, but Vi is quick to stop him. Later, she takes Powder with her outside and talks to her about her and the boys' failures to show her sister that no one is infallible.
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Vi begins the season in a state of despair and isolation, taking up pitfighting in Zaun as a way to channel her pain. This phase reflects her internal struggle as she copes with the fallout from Season 1, particularly her fractured relationship with Jinx.
 Her relationship with Jinx takes center stage once again as the sisters are forced to confront their shared trauma and their diverging paths. When Warwick (revealed to be Vander) is unleashed upon the city, Vi and Jinx team up to face him. This reunion highlights their enduring bond despite their differences. In a deciding moment during the final battle at the Hex Gate tower, Jinx sacrifices herself to save Vi from Warwick, detonating a grenade that causes the tower to explode. Jinx’s fate remains uncertain, leaving Vi grappling with grief and hope.
 Vi’s relationship with Caitlyn also evolves significantly throughout the season. Initially strained by misunderstandings and betrayals, they reconcile by the series’ end. In a poignant final scene, they are shown together in an ornate house, symbolizing a hopeful new chapter for both characters.
 As Piltover and Zaun rebuild after the battles, Vi reflects on the losses she has endured while holding onto hope for the future. 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Vi is a sassy and direct person. She is hot-headed and gets criticized for her impatience, as she can become reckless when angered. She is shown to be guilt-ridden over leaving Powder and what has happened to her adoptive family, which leads to her distancing herself when she fears loved ones could get in harm's way yet again. While she was in prison, she seemed to have gotten more of an edge and started to build walls around herself, never showing anyone vulnerability unless they had earned her trust.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Vi is a young woman of average height and muscular build. She has pink hair, with one side of her head shaved and the hair on the other side long and messy. She has a tattoo that spells ""VI"" under her left eye and another big tattoo across her spine area up to her neck and her arms. Her ears and left nostril are pierced, and she has scars on her left eyebrow and one on her upper lip. Her eyes are a silvery, powder blue with darker blue flecks, and she later dyes most of her hair black, with barely any pink parts left.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Hand-to-hand combat:  Vi is a skilled brawler, having been taught by Vander since her youth. 
 Parkour:  Vi is extremely athletic, having no difficulties scaling rooftops and returning to Zaun from Piltover through an unconventional method by jumping off a cliff to running across a steel beam. 
 Trivia [ ] 
 Vi's eye color is called Powder Blue with HEX code #B0E0E6.

 Felicia had dark purplish-blue hair, which in the flashback with Vander, was put in a single plait. She also wore several necklaces and a black ribbed shirt with O-ring thin sleeves. She has angular features and pale skin; her daughters clearly took the most after her.
 Connol, as shown in a flashback with a drawing-like style, representing his daughters’ memories, had tan-olive skin, dark brown eyes, and dark brown short hair. While his daughters shared most features with Felicia, he had a very similar nose shape when compared to that of his daughter Vi.

 Death [ ] 
 Her life is the same as the main universe (from what we see) up until her death in  Jayce 's laboratory. When the  Hextech  gemstones explode she is killed in the accident, leaving  Powder ,  Mylo , and  Claggor  to grieve for her in the remains of the explosion.
 
 Legacy [ ] 
 Because of her death, a strand of unknown events happen that causes  Vander  to forgive  Silco  and vice versa; Vander,  Benzo , Mylo, and Claggor to not die, and for  Zaun  to become an independent nation. Powder keeps a small altar for Vi in her home that has a painting of her, a doll with a music box, incense sticks, and a drawer with hidden hextech gemstones.

 Biography [ ] 
 Season 1, Act One [ ] 
 Viktor was born in the  Undercity , where the less than ideal environment attributed to his malformed leg. Later on, in his teenage years, he was found by  Heimerdinger , who offered Viktor the position of his assistant in  Piltover . 
 As a child, Viktor was left out due to his disability. Born with a malformed leg and needing a cane to walk, his mobility issues inhibited him from playing with other children. Despite his loneliness, he was incredibly intelligent. He fostered an engineering talent, even creating a working model steamboat he completes and tests within a flashback at the start of  Episode Six . In this episode, he meets  Sky  for the first time as a child, watching him as he toyed with the boat.
 After placing the boat in a stream to test-run it, the current of the water pulls it downstream faster than he can keep up with. Demonstrating recklessness even as a child, Viktor chooses to follow the stream down into a dark, cave-like room - where he finds it in the hands of  Singed , a scientist who is attempting to preserve the life of a mutated  Waverider  named  Rio .
 Praising Viktor for the quality of his invention, Singed allows Viktor to assist him in caring for Rio, feeding her what appears to be an early, raw variant of  Shimmer . 
 After finding Rio in contorted in pain and hooked up to a series of machines, Viktor is horrified. Singed claims, ""The mutation must survive,"" - but Viktor is unaccepting of his ethos and runs away.
 How  Heimerdinger  discovers Viktor is unclear. Still, somewhere in his late teens, Heimerdinger encounters him and takes him under his wing, allowing him to study at the University of Piltover. Viktor goes on to become his assistant as Dean of the Academy.
 
While investigating on Heimerdinger's behalf, Viktor first meets  Jayce Talis , a fellow scientist whose illegal research is interrupted and exposed by a robbery. Viktor risks stealing Jayce's notebook from Heimerdinger's office and seeks Jayce out to discuss its contents with him. After successfully talking a suicidal Talis off the edge of his destroyed apartment, Viktor reassures Jayce that hope is not lost. ""If you're going to change the world, don't ask for permission."" - Viktor Jayce and Viktor begin working in what is presumably Viktor's office, discovering that the gemstones Jayce acquired can only operate under a much higher frequency. Jayce expresses a desire to explain his discovery to the council, to which Viktor retaliates they have an absence of proof. After realizing his equipment will be destroyed the following day, Jayce is devastated - leading Viktor to suggest breaking into Heimerdinger's lab to retrieve it.
 Once they arrive at the lab, Viktor and Jayce are caught by  Mel Medarda , who, after being convinced by Jayce's speech, allows them one night to prove they are risk-worthy. Viktor displays a mild disgust or irritation at Jayce's attraction to Mel, hinting at his disinterest in romance.
 
 Season One, Act Two [ ] 
 When we see him again in Act II, Viktor lives in the shadow of Jayce, who is getting far more credit for their invention of  Hextech . Viktor looks sickly, and after he collapses at his desk, it is revealed that he is terminally ill. His diagnosis only spurs his drive to continue in his research, dedicating himself to discovering the workings of the arcane.
 Spurred on by  Mel Medarda's  influence, Jayce considers using their technology to create weapons to defend Piltover, to which Viktor is violently opposed.
 In a bid to prolong his longevity, he seeks out the doctor, who gives him a vial of a  shimmer  variant, which he takes in conjunction with exposure to the  Hexcore . His bad leg is healed, and he is able to walk for the first time. However, the effects are temporary, and he turns to the Hexcore again. This time, his assistant  Sky Young  is vaporized accidentally, filling Viktor with guilt.
 He stops interfering with the Hexcore, asking Jayce to destroy it.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Viktor is a driven and innovative scientist with an altruistic passion. Due to his disability, Viktor's childhood was spent isolated and separate from other children. This led to strong introversion in his personality - as well as a relative lack of understanding of social cues - when discussing Jayce's notes on  Hextech  with the previously suicidal  Jayce Talis .
 Throughout series one, Viktor becomes increasingly ambitious in his endeavors - from stealing Jayce's notes to breaking into a lab to experimenting on himself. There is also a hint of narcissism in this side of his personality - he speaks dejectedly to  Professor Heimerdinger  of a failure in securing his ""legacy"". He confesses he fears that his contributions will be ""short-lived"".
 However, in Act 2, his actions mainly revolve around Jayce's actions.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Viktor is a white man of average height with pale skin, moles, brown hair, and striking amber eyes. In Act I, he can be seen in the  University of Piltover 's uniform of a long-sleeved burgundy shirt with golden buttons, a white waistcoat with dark grey lining, and diamond-shaped white buttons. He also sports a white tie tied in an Eldredge knot (unlike Jayce's red tie - from this, we can presume that ties are indicative of status at the University, as Jayce is a student and Viktor is the Dean's assistant), as well as dark grey trousers and shoes. While he is shown to use a wooden cane, he is without it in certain scenes, suggesting he does not completely rely on it to walk yet.
 By Acts Two and Three of Season One, Viktor's physical stature strongly reflects his health. His hair is longer and less well-kept, he has more prominent and shadowy eyebrows, and his skin is so pale that it almost takes on a blue tinge in some lighting. Due to a significant loss of weight, his clothes appear more crumpled, swapping his burgundy shirt for a brown pinstripe one often rolled up to the elbows, an off-white and grey waistcoat with longer tails and an angular pattern across the front. He also now uses a crutch instead of a cane, impeding his gait and giving him a hunched posture.
 In Season Two when Viktor emerges from the hexcore cocoon, his body is transformed into a machine-like form. His eyes transform in between an array of colors as well. Just like his leg and hand from Season One, his skin is now a stringy purple metal-like texture. Purple glows from underneath this skin, which fades into Viktor’s natural skin color at his cheeks. Gold metal is strewn throughout his skin, mostly on his torso, neck, joints, and arms. He wears the blanket Jayce gives him as a cloak, which becomes his main outfit in Act 1 along with his cane which has an arcane-infected texture.
 In Act Two, Viktor now has longer hair with blonde tipped strands by his ears. The cloak he wore in earlier episodes is now wrapped around his body and strapped together with white belts and golden adornments. His cane is now more similar to a staff, with the handle curving into a more circular shape with golden accents.
 Transformed into the Machine Herald, Viktor’s face is split in two to make room for the geometrical ”mask” in the middle of his face. The eyes on the mask are glowing orange, and the tips of the mask are gold; along with multiple other gold accents across his body such as the ones on his wrists, shoulders, back, and feet. In this form he is much taller and lankier, with his torso being somewhat separated from his legs at the hips with large indents in between the two parts. Viktor has a third arm coming out from his back with a three fingered “claw” at the end. Each of the fingers is tipped in gold with the middle of the claw being a purple glowing circle. This claw is used for arcane magic. Viktor’s cane is now completely transformed into a staff, with the top of the staff being used to hold the  wild rune . His cloak is also tied around his neck, with the cloth underside being red.

 Biography [ ] 
 Ximena first appears in Jayce's flashback in  episode 2 , where she collapses and nearly dies from presumably hypothermia, and was frostbitten as shown by a close up of her blackened fingers. She and Jayce are saved by a mysterious figure using magic, something she does not want Jayce to continue pursuing. When she appears later on, she is shown to lost some of her fingers in this incident, having gold prosthetic fingers.
 She is a member of House Talis, a toolmaking House known for their invention of the collapsible pocket wrench. Her voice holds some weight in the  Piltover Council  during Jayce's trial, when she backs up  Heimerdinger  and  Cassandra Kiramman's  vote for Jayce not to be exiled. She claims he is not of his right mind and that his dreams of research are impossible. She later tells him she said what she had to in order to keep him safe, indicating she would support his dreams if they were safer.
 In  episode 4 , she can be seen among the crowds on Progress Day. In  episode 7 , she comforts Jayce as he decides whether or not to take violence against  Zaun .
