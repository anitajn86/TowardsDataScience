 History [ ] 
 In exchange for Amara's ""generous"" donations to the Academy, several Council members helped ensure that her trading business was extended certain leniencies at the borders. Thus, she was one of several people affected when the newly appointed  Councilor   Jayce Talis , in his desire to ensure the safety and protection of the Hexgates and prevent corruption from affecting this, ordered the  enforcers  to more strictly inspect all merchandise that went through the gates.
 For this, Amara conferred with Council  Bolbok  about their possible action or other possible arrangements. With a target now on Jayce's back and several powerful enemies,  Councilor Medarda  advised Jayce to stand down and make his own deals with them. Jayce agreed and, when Amara showed reluctance, told her that she would be investing in his Hextech research and thus access to new developments as they became available. Amara eagerly accepted. [1] 
 Amara asks  Ambessa Medarda  for a private hearing, where she then reveals she is a part of the  Black Rose . She uses her magic to restrain the other woman along with her  guard , and attempts to kill the two. Ambessa breaks out of her hold, and stabs Amara to death.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 
 I will give you the world, child,  if  you prove you can take it.
 
 Ambessa to  Mel ,  The Monster You Created 
 When she was ten, her father brought her to the aftermath of the Battle of Hildenard to collect weapons from the fallen in exchange for a gold coin each, exposing her to death at the tender age.
 She tried to imbue the same principles in her two known children, particularly in her daughter  Mel , whom Ambessa tried to mold into a warrior and leader willing to do whatever is necessary to ensure their survival from a young age. This seemingly proved futile, however, as her son  Kino  preferred diplomacy over war. Mel adapted his way of thinking and came to see war and killing only as a last resort.
 
 
 Because  you  weakened me! I couldn't endure the look in your eyes whenever I made the decisions—the necessary decisions to keep us safe!
 
 Ambessa on why she sent  her own daughter  away,  The Monster You Created 
 Eventually, she sent Mel away from their home to  Piltover , pointing out that her sentimentality would work well among the “soft-spined idealists,” and would later use the excuse that it was for her to oversee their family's interests in the city. [2]  In truth, she sent her away because she could no longer bear Mel's disapproval of her decisions. [3] 
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Mel eventually came to power in Piltover as a  Councilor  and the wealthiest person in the city, [4]  and she would later sponsor the research of  Jayce Talis  into  Hextech  that then revolutionized trade and travel in the world, thus having a hand in Piltover's undeniable progress. [5] 
 Apparently too distracted to have been able to do anything at the time, her son Kino was killed by a man who earned his ire. [2]  Ambessa realized that the man was not done with his grudge and would strike again and could have enough resources to potentially overpower them. [3]  To aid their victory in a potential war, Ambessa visited Piltover in hopes of getting her hands on weaponized Hextech.
 Having heard the news of the city's ongoing conflict with  Zaun , she tried to convince Mel and Jayce to finally engage the undercity in war and use his Hextech weapons. Mel determinedly refused and convinced the Council to avoid any war-inciting actions as well, but Jayce was swayed enough to attack one of  Silco 's  Shimmer  factories with  Vi . However, when Jayce accidentally killed  a boy , [2]  he completely changed his mind.
 Mel confronted her about her manipulation of Jayce, and she finally told Mel about the impending conflict at Noxus. She then asked Mel to let the war happen, after which she would be welcome back home and at her side. Mel would ultimately turn down the offer, taking off her family ring as she agreed to Jayce's proposal of peace with Zaun by granting them their requested independence. [3] 
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Immediately after  Jinx  attacks the  council , Ambessa rushes over to her daughter and asks if she's alright. Once Mel confirms that she's fine, Ambessa orders her soldiers to assist the  Enforcers . [6] 
 Eventually, Ambessa wheels a wheelchair-bound Salo into the council room, who proposes a purge for the Zaun demons. Despite Mel's proposal, the remaining council members rule against her, and Ambessa suggests notifying the public of the invasion. In the end, Mel agrees to the invasion, but to Ambessa's disapproval, no hextech will be used. [6] 
 Ambessa is mentioned in a conversation between Jayce and Mel when Mel updates Jayce about how the council meeting went in his absence. [6] 
 On the night after the attack on the citizens of Piltover amid Mel's speech, Ambessa is seen talking to  Rictus . [6] 
 Ambessa later attends a meeting with the surviving council members about how  Renni  and her cohorts launched an attack on Piltover. She also stands idly by when  Caitlyn  announces an attack on Zaun. [6] 
 On her ship with Rictus close by, Ambessa has an audience with  Amara , who was there not as the Merchant Guild Leader, but to settle a debt. Unamused by the proposal, Ambessa is shocked to learn that Amara is a medium of her  mortal enemy  who temporarily restrains her and Rictus. The possessed Amara threatens Ambessa for trying to acquire Hextech, and at that moment, Rictus activates his weapon, freeing them of their magical restraints by the possessed Amara. Ambessa then kills the possessed Amara, who boldly claims her death means nothing, and after this, Ambessa orders Rictus to triple the guards. Rictus suggests involving Mel, but Ambessa is against it, stating that she's better off their enemy for her safety. [6] 
 Afterward, Ambessa visits Salo, who receives  Shimmer  treatment for his broken legs. They briefly discuss how Caitlyn caused a stir in the last council meeting. After a contentious moment between them, Ambessa requests that he rally all nobles and politically powerful people. [6] 
 Ambessa is mentioned in a conversation with the Shimmering applier,  Lest , who informs her about Ambessa's meeting with Salo and is later seen watching beside Salo as Piltover is overwhelmed by colorful smog. [6] 
 Eventually, Salo holds the gathering with all of the influential people from Piltover, who announced the death of Amara at the hands of two Zaun assassins. Arguing for the best interests of the families of Piltover, martial law must be imposed, and Caitlyn would be the general who leads it. Flashbacks reveal that Ambessa manipulated the events that led to Renni's ambush. [6] 
 Ambessa is mentioned in a conversation between Caitlyn and  Maddie . [7] 
 She later oversees a failed experiment with the hex crystal and vents her frustrations over it to Rictus, over Jayce's and  Heimerdinger  disappearances, and her Mel's. [7] 
 Sometime later, Ambessa joins Caitlyn and Maddie, asking for a private conversation with Caitlyn. She proposes that an arrest be made on someone who could lead to the capture of Jinx. Despite Caitlyn arguing that peace must always be settled with more violence, but Ambessa gives a lofty speech and leaves the final choice to her. [7] 
 Amessa oversees an interrogation that Rictus performs and later passes by Jinx and  Sevika , but doesn't engage with them. It's outside; she has an encounter with Singed's Monster. [7] 
 Eventually, Ambessa and Caitlyn interrogate Sang about the monster he summoned, but he refuses to answer any of their questions. [8] 
 Later, Ambessa visits Singed in his cell who notes he was expecting her. Ambessa offers Singed a deal to join her as an advisor for his freedom, and he accepts the offer by reclaiming his musical compass. Singed also reveals to Ambessa that the monster he created was once a man with a guilt-ridden past. Despite his inability to harness its mind, he notes he has found a catalyst. [8] 
 In the Oculorum, Kino informs Mel that their mother had an affair with someone in the past that led to the birth of a child the Black Rose is interested in. On Ambessa's side, she accompanies Caitlyn, and they both witness the revelation of Singed's goal to revive his  daughter . [8] 
 Ambessa trains Caitlyn in spearcraft, and she gives her fighting advice. They're soon joined by Ambessa, who reveals that his monster was tracked to Zaun. [9] 
 Following Singed's compass, they find Viktor's encampment. There, they're met by  Huck , who requests that no weapons be brought through despite Ambessa wanting to use Rictus to force their way in. Singed reasons that Viktor was his former student and could talk with him. Singed does and later informs Ambessa that Viktor has found a way to cure the beast of his condition; however, that'd compromise their plans. Therefore, he plans to craft a serum to prevent this. [9] 
 Soon, Caitlyn arrives and reveals that she has captured Vi. Once she's restrained, Singed, Rictus, and Caitlyn leave their tent as Ambessa talks to Vi. Ambessa thanks Vi for leaving her, allowing Ambessa to fill the void in Caitlyn's heart. On the other hand, Vi reveals the three things that Vander taught about trust and further reveals that her capture was a ruse. The free Vi captures Ambessa in an electrical net, which incapacitates her for a while, and later finds the corpse of Rictus. [9] 
 The  Illusionary Sorceress  briefly takes on the form of Ambessa and reveals that her pride cost her Kino's life. She also reveals that Ambessa is the cause of an impending war, which Mel is the key to preventing. [10] 
 Ambessa oversees Rictus' burial as a monologue between her and Singed, who regrets not being able to save him because of his injuries. However, Ambessa claims that they do not mourn, but plan revenge. [10] 
 She later gets an update from Singed, who tells her his progress on his cure for death. As he does, Viktor possesses his followers as a way to communicate with them. He tells them that his end is nigh and that although he has the potential to evolve others, Jayce's attack has proven to be effective. Ambessa deals with Viktor to evolve her soldiers, and Viktor claims he'll evolve everyone willing. [10] 
 Ambessa is mentioned in a conversation between Caitlyn and Maddie, and then with Caitlyn and Vi. She's alluded to during a confrontation between Jayce, Viktor, and Mel. [10] 
 Mel later visits her mother at her camp and mentions that she knows about the Black Rose, which she scoffs at, calling them liars. However, when questioned about Kino's death, she slaps Mel and explains her reasoning for allowing him to die. [10] 
 Although Mel asks her mother to leave Piltover, and she accompanies her, Ambessa refuses because of her Noxian pride. She then shows what Viktor promised her, causing Mel to question what her mother was thinking. [10] 
 Amid the invasion of Piltover, Ambessa is sniped at by Caitlyn, who she compliments as bold, and then signals her men to unleash a deeply Shimmered Noxian soldier to pull in Viktor's orb. [11] 
 She later appears before Caitlyn and her spy  Maddie , who, after stabbing Caitlyn in the side, walks away to allow Maddie to kill her, but is killed by her ricocheted bullet. A set of doors open nearby, revealing Mel behind them who pleads to her surrender, but she refuses to. [11] 
 Once Viktor's orb is broken, it's revealed that it is empty, making Ambessa smile as Viktor's dolls ambush and usurp control of nearly everyone there. After Mel chastises her, Caitlyn punches Ambessa and challenges her to a duel. When Ambessa gets the upper hand on Caitlyn, she cuts off Ambessa's magical ward that allows Mel to summon the Illusionary Sorceress who entraps Ambessa in her magical realm. However, Mel appears and frees her mother from the Illusionary Sorceress' realm and listens to her mother's final words as she dies in her arms. [11] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Ambessa is a woman of unshakable confidence, displaying no vulnerability or emotional weakness. Raised in Noxus, where strength is paramount, she embraces aggression over passivity, reflecting the harsh upbringing her father instilled in her and the ruthless Noxian culture. Her cold, merciless nature toward enemies is tempered by a hedonistic enjoyment of Piltover's luxuries and the exotic foods of foreign lands, a reflection of her appreciation for power and indulgence. A master of eloquent speech and brutal force, she deftly manipulates situations and people to serve her and her family’s interests, whether through words or actions.
 Although she values violence as a means to secure her position, Ambessa isn’t entirely dismissive of diplomacy. Her decision not to exile Kino—despite his purely diplomatic approach—suggests that while aggression is favored, she recognizes the tactical value of negotiation when it suits her. However, she is selective with her violence, always considering the long-term impact of her actions. Ready to eliminate threats if necessary, she believes that killing one person can sometimes prevent a larger, more destructive conflict down the line. Above all, Ambessa is a survivor, willing to take any action to protect her family and their legacy.
 Ambessa respects aggression in all its forms—be it in warfare or diplomatic dealings—but she equally values cunning, provided it doesn’t undermine the display of power. Her advice to her daughter, Mel, about embodying ""both the fox and the wolf"" underscores this duality: while one can favor one trait over the other, true success in her family demands mastery of both. The greatest offense in her eyes is not a lack of cunning or aggression, but the display of weakness or incompetence, which she sees as unforgivable.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Ambessa is a strong, muscular woman with rich brown skin and light brown eyes. Her coily hair, ranging from grey to black, is styled loosely above her shoulders, complementing her fierce, warrior-like appearance. She wears regal Noxian attire, befitting her high rank, primarily in black and red, with metallic silver accents. A red cloak with black fur drapes over her shoulder, further enhancing her commanding presence. Her face and upper body are marked with numerous battle scars, a testament to her hardened life as a warlord and her willingness to engage in direct combat.
 In Season 2, Ambessa has her hair braided back into three braids capped in gold. She wears her battle attire, which consists of tan and black garb with accents of gold and red threads, red cloth wrapped around her arms, and golden triangular earrings. In Act 1, she wears a regal headpiece with which she wraps her braids and a militaristic black jacket with large golden shoulder pieces and accents. Ambessa has dark brown lipstick with a golden stripe on her bottom lip and red stripes painted under her eyes. In battle, Ambessa wears a golden feline-like mask.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Skilled Melee Combatant : Ambessa Medarda is a formidable melee fighter, known for her proficiency with a weapon resembling a katar. Her remarkable reflexes and agility are evident in her ability to swiftly and decisively eliminate opponents, including executing a clean decapitation with a single strike. Her combat style reflects the precision and efficiency instilled in her by years of training and battle experience.
 Manipulative Strategist : Ambessa excels in manipulation and psychological warfare, using her keen understanding of others’ emotions to further her objectives. One notable example is her ability to persuade Chem-Baroness  Renni  to lead an assault on Piltover’s memorial for council members killed by Jinx. While feigning sympathy for Piltover’s loss, she used their grief as leverage to convince them to invade Zaun. Her success lies in her strategic use of emotional manipulation, turning the Chem-Baroness's sorrow into a weapon that serves her broader goals.
 
 Trivia [ ] 
 The name ""Ambessa"" means ""lion"" in Amharic. 
 Ambessa is the first character to be added as an official  League of Legends  champion because of  Arcane . She was originally only ever in the show, but got so popular with people that Riot decided to include her in the game.

 Biography [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 One day, there is an explosion in  Piltover , which is rumored to have been caused by  Vander 's children. Later that night, Vander appeared, but Benzo wasn't surprised and sent  Ekko  outside. Not long after that, the  Enforcers  appear, and  Grayson  urges them to tell her who is responsible for the explosion, thereby easing the  Council 's mind. [1] 
 Benzo stands beside Vander when he debates with  Sevika  about how to approach  the Enforcers . When Sevika and her men leave, Benzo consoles Vander. [2] 
 Right after Vander locked away  Vi  in the basement of his store, Benzo stood by as  Marcus  and Grayson arrested Vander. Outside, an  unknown assailant  kills Grayson, and Benzo picks up a nearby pipe to arm himself with. From the foggy shadows,  Silco  appears, enraging Benzo, who curses and tries to attack him against Vander's will not to. Out of nowhere, Benzo is attacked and killed by  Deckard , who is under the influence of  Shimmer . [3] 
 A Benzo from an alternate universe enters his store after Ekko has a bit of a meltdown and notes that it's one of those days. Powder claims that it's just the twins acting up and as Benzo asks that they take it outside, Ekko tearfully falls into his chest. [3] 
 Afterward, Benzo cordially talks to Vander at the Last Drop. [3]

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 
 I'm a misfit too, I suppose.
 
 Caitlyn to  Jayce ,  Some Mysteries Are Better Left Unsolved 
 Born into the wealthy Kiramman family, Caitlyn always felt that her parents, especially  her mother , sheltered her, thus hindering her personal growth in their hopes of protecting her and convincing her to follow in her footsteps to effectively carry on their family name. [1] [2] [3] 
 Caitlyn grew to become a very skilled marksman. Once, she joined a competition in Piltover and won the trophy. She confronted her closest opponent in the competition, the  Piltover Police Department  Sheriff  Grayson , about throwing the competition for her, suspecting that her parents had paid her to do it. Grayson admitted to letting her win only because she felt that the girl deserved it, not because of her parents, then asked her what she was shooting for. [2] 
 She also became very close to  Jayce Talis , an Academy student her parents were sponsoring. Caitlyn was with him when his laboratory exploded after a break-in, angering her mother further about the risk Jayce had apparently put her in. Though Caitlyn and her father managed to convince her mother to speak for Jayce during the trial, it ultimately still went against his favor, much to Caitlyn's disappointment. [4] 
 Caitlyn eventually joined the Piltover Police Department and became an Enforcer. Through the cases she encountered and her investigations, Caitlyn came to the theory that someone was secretly at the center of all the violence the  Undercity  was involved in. Her investigations on this were never taken seriously, however, because they were being dismissed and unknowingly stonewalled by the Sheriff during her time,  Marcus , who was, in fact, in cahoots with the man she was investigating. [1] [5] 
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 [1] 
 [2] 
 [6] 
 [7] 
 [8] 
 [9] 
 Caitlyn is introduced as an ambitious young woman who rejects the expectations of her aristocratic family. Rather than pursuing a life of luxury, she chooses to join the Piltover Enforcers, driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to make a difference. Her sharp intellect, investigative skills, and determination quickly set her apart from her peers. However, Caitlyn’s idealism often clashes with the corruption and bureaucracy within Piltover’s law enforcement system.
 Her journey takes a significant turn when she investigates the explosion at Jayce’s lab and its connection to Zaun. This leads her to  Vi , an imprisoned fighter from Zaun who is knowledgeable about the criminal underworld. Caitlyn frees Vi from  Stillwater Hold , forming an unlikely partnership that becomes central to the story. Despite their vastly different upbringings, Caitlyn and Vi develop mutual respect and trust as they work together to uncover the growing tensions between Piltover and Zaun.
 Through her alliance with Vi, Caitlyn gains firsthand exposure to the struggles of Zaun’s oppressed citizens. This challenges her privileged worldview and deepens her understanding of systemic inequality. Her experiences in Zaun strengthen her resolve to fight for justice, not just in Piltover but for both cities. Caitlyn’s compassion and moral clarity often serve as a counterbalance to Vi’s more impulsive tendencies, making their partnership both dynamic and complementary.
 Caitlyn also plays a key role in uncovering  Silco ‘s schemes and his use of  Shimmer  to consolidate power in Zaun. Her investigative prowess helps expose the corruption and danger threatening both cities. However, as tensions escalate between Piltover and Zaun, Caitlyn finds herself caught between loyalty to her city and her growing empathy for Zaun’s plight.
 By the end of Season 1, Caitlyn emerges as a more mature and determined figure. Her relationship with Vi deepens into a bond marked by mutual care and understanding, laying the foundation for their future partnership. Despite witnessing immense violence and betrayal—culminating in  Jinx ’s catastrophic attack on the  Piltover Council —Caitlyn remains steadfast in her commitment to justice.
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Caitlyn begins the season mourning the death of her mother, Cassandra Kiramman, who was killed during Jinx’s  attack  on the Piltover Council in the  Season 1 finale . This devastating loss pushes Caitlyn into a darker mindset, fueling her desire for revenge against Jinx and Zaun. As a leader within Piltover’s enforcers, Caitlyn becomes more determined and ruthless in her pursuit of justice. Her grief drives her to make morally questionable decisions, including actions that risk innocent lives, which creates tension in her relationship with Vi. Despite their growing romantic bond, Caitlyn’s unrelenting focus on vengeance sometimes shocks and alienates Vi.
 Caitlyn’s political role expands when  Ambessa Medarda  appoints her as head of Piltover’s police force. Though initially reluctant to accept such a position, Caitlyn sees it as an opportunity to protect Piltover from further chaos. However, her alliance with Ambessa—a  Noxian  warlord with her own agenda—complicates Caitlyn’s moral compass. As she works to consolidate power and suppress Zaun’s rebellion, Caitlyn begins to question whether her actions align with the ideals she once stood for.
 Throughout the season, Caitlyn’s relationship with Vi serves as a grounding force. After being separated for months, their reunion rekindles Caitlyn’s sense of purpose and humanity. Together, they face challenges such as rescuing  Vander  (now transformed into Warwick) and confronting Ambessa’s manipulations. These experiences force Caitlyn to reflect on how far she has strayed from her principles and help her rediscover the values that define her.
 In the  final battle , Caitlyn plays a pivotal role in defending Piltover against Ambessa and Noxian forces. Despite suffering significant injuries—including losing an eye during a duel with Ambessa—Caitlyn demonstrates courage and resilience. She ultimately rejects Ambessa’s influence and recommits herself to protecting Piltover without compromising her integrity.
 By the end of the season, Caitlyn reconciles with Vi in an emotional moment that symbolizes hope for their relationship and their shared mission. Wearing an eyepatch from her injuries, Caitlyn reflects on her journey while reaffirming her dedication to justice. Her arc concludes with a sense of redemption as she moves forward with renewed clarity and strength.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 When she first appears, Caitlyn is a young, curious, and fairly sheltered upper-class child, albeit somewhat of an outcast, isolated by her family's wealth. 
 Even as a young teen, Caitlyn is determined and dedicated, as shown in her shooting tournament with Grayson, and something that sticks with her later in her adulthood. Her level-headedness and strong moral compass lead her to be an enforcer against her parent's wishes. However, her tendency to follow her heart before her head leads to her being isolated from fellow enforcers again and causing problems for her corrupt higher-ups.
 She is deeply compassionate and empathetic, but her naïvety often causes her to come off as stuck up to the people of the Undercity and sometimes her fellow Piltovans.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Caitlyn is 6,1 (185cm) tall with heels (about 5,8 (172cm) without), with a lean frame and toned muscles from her training as an enforcer. 
 She has sharp, angular facial features, bright blue eyes, pale lips, and fair skin. Her dark navy blue hair falls just below her collarbone and is styled in a side part for her appearances in  episodes four  and  five . She later puts her hair up in a ponytail to keep it out of her face while in the lanes. 
 For her first few appearances (as an adult), she wears an enforcer uniform, which is made up of a short-sleeved, navy blue dress with a white panel in the center of the bodice and gold detailing, ending in a loose white ruffle just above the knee, on top of which she wears a belt with a gold decorative buckle, navy blue shoulder pads/epaulets with gold details, and she a white ruffled collar, held in place thin black band and gold buckle. In addition, she wears dark brown knee-high boots, white socks, and fingerless gloves/arm coverings in the same colors. As part of the uniform, she also has a tall, brimless hat in the enforcer's signature blue and white.
 When she changes outfits to blend in while she's with  Vi  in  Zaun , she keeps her boots, but now wears a white undershirt, dark lilac vest, and matching trousers, with a piece of brown, leather-like material which is attached to the purple bodice by gold buttons on her shoulders, with added gold detail, widening from the small of her back to end in a skirt just below her hips buttoned under her bust and secured by two belts on the sides. A sleeve in the same color covers her right arm, and on her left, she wears a brown elbow-length fingerless glove and a white ruffled armband secured with a belt and buckle on her upper arm. In addition, she wears a small choker with a gold pendant.
 She is later captured by  Jinx  and put back in her enforcer outfit in  episode 9 .
 In Act 1 of Season 2 Caitlyn wears a new enforcer outfit. The outfit consists of a navy blue jacket with a lighter middle, and has golden accents and brown straps on the shoulders and arms, with the right sleeve being black and with a shoulder pad adorned with gold. She wears a white frilly undershirt with a red choker, and wears a white beret with golden accents.
 In Act 2 Caitlyn wears her hair down with a long black cape. The cape is also accented with gold and a large red collar.
 In her battle outfit she wears the same black and gold armor that  Jayce  and  Vi  wear on their chests. This outfit has her with her hair back up, as well as black army pants and large black and golden shoulder pads.
 In the ending, she wears a black turtleneck and blue eye-patch.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Precision shooting : Caitlyn has an advanced talent in shooting. She is a skilled sniper, and had won a shooting competition when she was younger. 
 Noxian martial arts. : Trained by  Ambessa , Caitlyn uses her knowledge of Noxian martial arts in her feet with the warlord. 
 Trivia [ ] 
 The name of Caitlyn's House (previously unnamed in  League of Legends ) was conceived by  Arcane  writer  Amanda Overton . [10]  The name has since been adapted in  League  canon. [11] 
 Caitlyn didn't appear in the alternate timeline in Season 2, Episode 7, and there is currently no credible source explaining her status in that timeline. 
 Caitlyn is in her 20s. 
 Caitlyn's official height, including the heels, is 185 cm (6'1). However, her and the other characters' heights are tweaked and adjusted to fit in specific scenes.

 Biography [ ] 
 History [ ] 
 Through her family's political influence and power, Cassandra earned a position on the Council of Piltover.
 At one point, she and her husband saw talent and ambition in young  Jayce Talis  and decided to support his education and research at the Academy as his patron. They granted him access to their building in the Academy district to serve as his workshop. [2] 
 
 Season I [ ] 
 Years later, when the workshop they were letting Jayce work out of was blown up after a break-in, Jayce's illicit research into the  Arcane  was exposed. Cassandra's husband was infuriated that Jayce had inadvertently placed  Caitlyn , who'd been at risk with him at the time. However, Cassandra and her daughter still decided to speak in favor of Jayce during the trial. Though she initially tried to speak about his good character and potential contributions to society, the trial quickly turned in his favor when he spoke about trying to create magic through science. Cassandra then agreed to the motion to expel him from the Academy without further objections. She refused to speak with Jayce further and even tried to keep Caitlyn from becoming friends with him. [2] 
 With  Councilor Medarda's  machinations, however, Jayce and his new partner  Viktor  managed to perfect his research, later   Hextech , and he was given the authority to continue working on it. [3]  Mrs. Kiramman eventually became one of the many entrepreneurs in Piltover to benefit from the creation of the  Hexgates . [4] 
 Eventually, her only daughter Caitlyn chose to become an  enforcer , a decision that she disapproved of. A few years later, Caitlyn was injured in an explosion that occurred at the end of Piltover's Progress Day and had killed six other enforcers. Fearing for her safety, Cassandra and her husband had Marcus remove her from the force.
 After the incident that also resulted in the theft of Jayce's Hextech Gemstone, the Council agreed to add him to their table as a Councilor. [3]  Jayce's new position made him aware of the regular corruption and bribery that occurred among businesses using his gates and ordered the strengthening of security, causing the Councilors and others to plot against him. Convinced by Mel, Jayce earned back the Council's favor by forging his own deals with each of them, including Cassandra. [4]  With this, she and the rest of the Council were easily convinced to agree with Jayce's later suggestion to force Heimerdinger to retire from the Council. [5] 
 Despite Caitlyn's dismissal as an enforcer, she continued to investigate her theories on  Zaun 's  underground crime organization . Caitlyn found her way to Zaun with a  guide  and returned a few days later, once again injured from another deadly explosion on the bridge, asking for a chance to present her findings to the Council. Caitlyn tried to explain to her how horrid the living situation was in Zaun and how the Council's passiveness was making it worse; with some convincing, she got them an audience at their next meeting. Despite their testimony on  Silco , the Council tried diplomacy instead to avoid initiating a war against the undercity. [6] 
 Jayce later informed the Council of a deal he'd made with Silco—their peace and the surrender of  the one  responsible for the recent explosions in exchange for Zaun's independence. After some discussion and objections, the Council unanimously agreed, only for the meeting to be bombed by Jinx with a rocket-powered by Jayce's Hextech Gemstone, with her daughter being able to witness the bombing from a safe distance away. [7] 
 
 Season II [ ] 
 Cassandra tragically dies in the attack, along with Councilors  Bolbok  and  Hoskel . Her mother's loss becomes a pivotal moment in Caitlyn's journey, deeply affecting her emotionally and shaping her motivations going forward. After the funeral, Caitlyn struggles with grief, questioning her role in continuing her mother's legacy. This loss also catalyzes her formation of a strike team to hunt down Jinx and dismantle the forces that threaten Piltover, including those linked to the Chem-Barons and Silco.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Cassandra is a noble woman, though she is generous. At first glance she comes off as posh and stuck up, but we see in Season One and Season Two that she cares for the people above and below her as well. When Jayce's research was compromised by  Heimerdinger  she still supports him, being his patron of many years. When Caitlyn and Vi return from the undercity she eventually gives in to her daughters pleas for change by scheduling an audience for them with the council. She also votes for  Zaun 's freedom in episode 9. In Season Two, we learn that she had funded a ventilation system in the undercity to free them from the  Grey . This shows that even though she is a powerful and rich noble of Piltover, she still cares for the people close to her but also those in the undercity.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Cassandra is a fair-skinned woman with an angular face and brown (later greying) hair. She has teal eyes and blue jewel earrings. Her outfit consists of a white ruffled undershirt with a black bowtie, covered by a maroon jacket with golden buttons. She wears a long maroon skirt and white gloves.

 Trivia [ ] 
 Cassandra's first name was revealed through flavor text on a  Magic: The Gathering   Secret Lair x Arcane  card (specifically the Path to Exile card featuring  Jayce Talis  and the line she spoke during his trial in  Some Mysteries Are Better Left Unsolved ). [1] 
 She was the one who cleared the polluted air from  Zaun  using an extensive ventilation system, although her work was attributed to the wind goddess  Janna . [8]  However, Cassandra didn’t seem to mind this and was happy just to help the people of the undercity.

 Biography [ ] 
 History [ ] 
 Heimerdinger was one of the founders of Piltover. [1]  According to  Councilor Bolbok , the city was established to escape the warmongering of  mages , [2]  with Heimerdinger himself having lived through at least one of those  wars . Ultimately, he came out of the conflict mentally and emotionally scarred with a strong paranoia and distrust for anything or anyone involved with magic. [2] [1] 
 At one point, he worked with a scientist known as  Singed , whose more radical experiments Heimerdinger presumably objected to, which lead to the latter's departure. [3] 
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 When Academy scholar  Jayce Talis 's workshop was caught in an explosion due to a break-in by  Zaunite  children, Heimerdinger sent his assistant  Viktor  to ensure that anything dangerous in the workshop was safely dealt with. He then visited Jayce personally in his cell and asked him about his unsanctioned research. When he found out that the boy was working on harnessing  magic  through science, Heimerdinger warned him of the dangers and advised him to let go of his dream and not to mention it during his Council hearing—advice that Jayce ultimately ignored. After  Jayce's mother  spoke to plead her son's case, instead of banishment as Councilor  Bolbok  first suggested, Heimerdinger instead moved to expel him from the Academy, which the whole Council agreed to. [2] 
 Despite the warnings, Jayce continued working on his  Hextech  project, this time with Viktor's help and encouragement from  Councilor Medarda . In a short amount of time, Jayce, with new knowledge supplied by Viktor, got the Hextech to function without destructive results. [4]  No longer able to deny its potential benefits, Jayce's research was encouraged and eventually led to the creation of the Hexgates that soon made Piltover a central trading port, advancing the city's progress decades ahead.
 When Jayce and Viktor tried to pitch their next Hextech plans to Heimerdinger, he was pleased with their new research but told them that it would only be ready for use years down the line after further studying to ensure its safety. [5]  When the duo showed Heimerdinger the Hexcore, he recognized its similarity to the kind of power he'd encountered from the past and feared and told them to destroy it, disappointing the pair — both of whom were desperate to use it somehow to cure Viktor and Jayce who wanted to fight back against the recent attacks on Piltover by Zaunites.
 His continued objection led to Jayce moving during their next Council meeting to force him to retire, with the other Councilors backing him due to Heimerdinger's speech about holding each other accountable in addition to deals Jayce had made with them with Mel's guidance, [1]  after which Jayce became his replacement as the de facto head. [3] 
 After his eviction from the Council, Heimerdinger went to Zaun, hoping to assist them. On his way back, he saw and was impressed with a hoverboard and met its owner,  Ekko . With the boy's leg injured, [6]  Heimerdinger accompanies him, and Ekko brings him back with him to the  Firelights'  base, where the two began discussing their thoughts on his inventions, particularly his hoverboard. [7] 
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 While in the  Firelights'  base, Ekko brings Heimerdinger the discovery of the corruption of a fallen leaf from the Firelight Tree, Heimerdinger realizes the similarities of corruption to the  Hexcore  and attempts to sneak into  Jayce's  Lab in the Academy with Ekko. Jayce caught them in the act, having spent the night in his lab.  [8] 
 After a discussion with Jayce, the three of them decide to head to the Hex Vault deep underneath the  Hexgate  where they discover an anomaly which consumes them.  [9] 
 Heimerdinger finds himself in a parallel universe where Hextech was never invented. While waiting for Ekko to appear in this universe, Heimerdinger busies himself with acquainting with the citizens of alternate  Zaun  as well as inventing items for them. Finally after one thousand, one hundred, twenty eight days, 6 hours and 20 minutes, Heimerdinger meets Ekko whom has just arrived in this alternative universe. Heimerdinger initially attempts to convince Ekko to spend the rest of their life in this alternative universe, but after Ekko's pleads, he agrees to help him to develop an alternative  Hexcore  so that they can use the anomaly to travel back. They enlist the help of alternate  Powder (Jinx)  and the three of them managed to develop a very small and unstable  Hexcore , as well as discovering an alternative property of it, the ability to reverse time. Heimerdinger continues his own research of it, and after a while, manages to develop a version that is able to send them back. Heimerdinger realizes that the device is only able to send one of them back and after tricking Ekko to enter it, he tells Ekko that only after meeting him has he ""truly lived"" and sacrifices himself by leaving the device to continue to operate it. As Heimerdinger connects the final power cable that triggers the device's activation, the device causes him to vanish, leaving him with an unknown fate.  [10] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Heimerdinger is an empathetic mentor with a love for science and education. While he cares a lot about the safety of his people, his near immortality and PTSD caused by the Rune Wars cause him to act rashly in response to anything related to magic, even when it can save lives. His trust in most people and his ironic naivety caused him to be somewhat complacent, as he was mostly unaware of the corruption in the Council or the brutality of the enforcers in  Zaun . He was both a typical wise elder who was ignored by corrupt politicians and a traumatized child who needed therapy. He was too focused on potential dangers to see the present issues.
 Due his immortality and already advanced age, Heimerdinger tends to take things far too slow for human standarts, always insisting the development of technology to be dealt slowly, suggesting decades of careful experimentation and overly safe measures, leading more than once to the frustration of fellow scientists who don't have such ludicrous lifespan to dedicate so much time to their goals.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Heimerdinger is a  Yordle  covered in yellow and white fur. He has a pink animalistic nose, white mustache, bright blue eyes, and pink skin. His ears are long and tipped with white fur. As a councilman, he wears a navy blue suit with gold embellishings.

 History [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 ""Chross"" was once a citizen of  Piltover  who moved to  Zaun  when he realized that his skill set, and personality worked well in the undercity. Chross made a name for himself as the ruthless and clever leader of a highly organized and dangerous gang. Soon, he became affiliated with other crime lords, [1]  forming the group of  chem-barons  that control the undercity, led by  Silco . [2]  Because of Silco's connections in Piltover, officers have been unable to track him down nor pin most crimes on him.
 At one point, one of his most infamous hitmen,  Nero Eso , was apprehended by  enforcers . Because he was captured by someone other than Silco's upper city asset,  Marcus , the hitman was interrogated, though he refused to give any substantial information on him and Silco. Silco ordered Nero to leave Progress Day pins at the sites of his hits to remind Chross of his origins. Another enforcer,  Caitlyn Kiramman , found the records of this and kept it as part of an ongoing investigation on  the underground's then unknown ruler  and his  mole  in Piltover. [1] 
 After the actions of Silco's adoptive daughter  Jinx  caused the closure of the borders to Piltover, Chross and the other chem-barons' businesses were affected. They called a meeting to discuss their next action, during which  Finn  tried to convince them to stand their ground against Silco and his unwillingness to stop Jinx's antics. Before they could discuss further, Silco arrived and unleashed a toxic gas in the air before giving them gas masks, reminding them of the insufferable past he'd saved them from. [2] 
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Chross attends a meeting between  Sevika  and the other Chem-Lords concerning the turf wars. Sevika suggests they unite against their common enemy, which is the Topside, and while Chross and  Madam Margot  are opposed,  Smeech  is for it but proposes a different solution. [3] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Chross is a manipulative man. He exploits children in the mines and fights with  Madam Margot  instead of uniting the nation to face  Piltover .
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Chross is a pale and wrinkly old man with white eyebrows. He is bald with large ears, chin, and forehead all sagging due to age. He has age spots over his face and a small tattoo on his forehead. He wears a dark navy blue jacket, hat, and pants decorated with bronze and a lighter undershirt with a circular bronze ornament on his neck. Chross has numerous bronze earrings on his earlobes and small black glasses, and he also uses a purple, bronze, and silver wheelchair.
 
 Trivia [ ] 
 It is unknown whether or not Chross is alive, as during the opening montage of  S203  he and Margot appear scared, then shattered like glass when an aim symbol appears on their faces.

 Biography [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Claggor was part of  Vi's   trip to Piltover to steal valuables  along with  Powder  and  Mylo . They were discovered by Enforcers after Powder accidentally caused an explosion by dropping a Hexcrystal. This sets off a manhunt through the streets of  Piltover , though the kids eventually escaped. Back on the  other side of the river ,  Deckard  is waiting for them, and a fight ensues. They win, but the valuables they stole from  Jayce ’s lab are accidentally lost. Later that evening, Vander takes him to  Benzo 's, where he has to wait outside. When the  Enforcers  arrive,  Ekko  urges him to leave and he runs away. [1] 
 Claggor would later participate in  Vander’s rescue , where he, along with Mylo, would be killed by a bomb created by Powder. 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Nervous, When preparing to break into the workshop he asks if they should still do it. He often questions if the group is doing the right thing and is not nearly as confident as his brother.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Claggor is a stocky, muscular teenager who is quite blocky in appearance, which is a nice ode to the use of shape language in Arcane. He seems to be the biggest of the teens, maybe besides Vi. Claggor has mouse brown hair that sits atop his head in soft waves parted above his right eye.
 His outfit consists of a shabby white long-sleeve shirt, with bands of twine holding the fabric in sections to his arms. He has what looks like a greenish archers brace over his right arm, turning into a stirrup that fits over the top of his hand. He has a leather belt that loops through some burlap pants and thick, clunky shoes. He also wears a pair of goggles, which throughout Act 1, are either seen perched on his head or worn to cover his eyes in combat.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 ????
 
 Trivia [ ] 
 Claggor’s voice actor,  Roger Craig Smith , makes him sound way older than he actually is, due to how deep Smith’s natural voice is. 
 Claggor’s goggles make him resemble Bobble from the Tinkerbell movie series.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 In his youth, Ekko worked for  Benzo  at his shop and often eavesdropped on several of his more private conversations even when the man would send him away. This made him privy to certain transactions and secrets that he would sometimes share with his friends:  Vi ,  Mylo ,  Claggor , and  Powder .
 Growing up, Ekko looked up to Vi and played with her younger sister, Powder. Vi taught him some fighting moves, [2]  He would sometimes go to the junk heap with Vi, who would then hose him down when he got too dirty. [1] 
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 While working at Benzo's one day,  a man  from  Piltover  came into the shop and bought items from him. [2] [3]  Ekko was easily able to charge him twice the items' normal price and then followed him. Thinking his friends could make quick cash off the man, Ekko told Vi about the workshop. The plan backfired when  Powder  accidentally caused an explosion in the man's home, initiating an investigation that led  enforcers  to Benzo's to confront  Vander .
 Despite being kicked out by Benzo prior so he and Vander could speak privately, Ekko listened in through a contraption he'd built above the room and found out that Vander had a deal with the  Sheriff , [2]  which he later told Vi with some hesitation. [3] 
 Ekko later witnessed Benzo's murder in the hands of a  Shimmer -affected  Deckard  under  Silco 's orders. He saw Silco and his men take Vander away and later tearfully told Vi where to find them — Silco's Shimmer factory. Shortly after, multiple explosions at the factory resulted in multiple deaths and Vi's disappearance, [4]  leading him to assume that she had also perished. Meanwhile,  Powder  was taken in by Silco, causing the two to be estranged.
 Forced to find a means to survive, Ekko eventually came to live in hiding with a group of other children, building their base in a rare space that housed one of the very few trees—if not the only tree—to survive in  Zaun . The group called themselves  the Firelights , after the  glowing insects  found in Zaun, [1]  and began sabotaging Silco's shipments of Shimmer in hopes of hindering its damage to their city. [5] [1] 
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Ekko is only twenty years old, but he acts and gives off this feeling of being very world weary because he feels like he's been around a lot longer than he actually has been. He's seen some shit. He's been a part of a lot of shit. And it's affected him, despite the fact that he's still very young. 
 When Ekko was younger, he had a carefree and goofy attitude, he quickly made best friends with  Powder  due to how playful both were. He was very enthusiastic about fighting hand to hand and looked up to  Vi  like an older sibling.  However, once  Benzo  was killed, and when he presumed that Vi perished in the explosions, his relationship with Powder also deteriorated as she joined forces with the same people who killed Benzo. 
 Ekko matured considerably, taking charge as the leader of the Firelights. Despite all the trauma inflicted on him, Ekko chose to fight for the people and focus on helping addicts and victims affected by Silco's  Shimmer  operation.  While he does retain his enthusiasm for his inventions and fighting, he is more reserved around people he's not familiar or comfortable around. 
 Because Ekko was born and raised in Zaun, the lower city, he has a biased negative opinion on Piltover residents, shown notably with his interactions with Caitlyn. He does seem to respect Heimerdinger, despite him being a former-council member at the time of their meeting. 
 Although Ekko keeps a tough exterior, it's clear that he keeps a lot of his emotions bottled inside. When he put up a front and acted cold against Vi, she was able to see right through the act, and embraced him, leading him to start crying. 
 Ekko is also particularly morally responsible when it comes to tough choices, as when he had the opportunity to stay in the alternate universe where Piltover and Zaun were united, Powder was his girlfriend, and where every character who died in the original timeline is alive (with the exception of Vi dying during the workshop heist). Instead of falling to the temptation of what was essentially a utopia, he chose to leave it so that he could go back to his universe to help and protect his city and his people, as he told Heimerdinger from the very beginning when he got into an alternate reality.  
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Ekko is of average height with a wiry, athletic build. His skin is a rich dark brown, contrasting sharply with his thick white hair. He styles his hair into bundled locks on top of his head, with the sides buzzed short. 
 His dark brown eyes, once soft and round in childhood, now carry a sharper, more intense expression. His eyebrows are straight and slightly angled downward, and his wide nose complements his defined facial structure. High cheekbones taper into a pointed chin, giving his face a sharp and distinct profile.
 Ekko’s attire reflects his life in Zaun and his leadership of the Firelights. He wears an oversized dark green jacket covered in neon graffiti-like scribbles, paired with baggy, off-white pants. An orange bandana tied around his neck is a signature part of his look. During combat, he often wears a white tank top for ease of movement.
 His most distinctive feature is the white hourglass symbol painted across his face, stretching from his forehead to the tip of his nose.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Time Rewind : Ekko can manipulate time with the Zero Drive (Z-Drive) that he created with the help of  Heimerdinger . He is capable of returning up to 4 seconds, while his physical condition remains unchanged. Attempting to rewind more than 4 seconds can cause harm against his surroundings, but strangely not Ekko himself. 
 Hand-to-hand combat : Ekko is an excellent combatant in close quarters, being capable of evading  Jinx’s  bullets and then subduing her.
 Inventor/Genius Intellect:  Ekko has always been adept at building inventions, and has impressed the likes of Heimerdinger, who has considerable knowledge as an immortal being. Ekko was also able to develop the Z-Drive by inverting Jayce's Acceleration Rune (with the help of  Powder  and Heimerdinger), showing that he can grasp  Arcane  topics almost as well as  Jayce .
 
 Trivia [ ] 
 Ekko liked his earrings in the alternate universe so much so that he got them pierced in his own universe. [6] [7]

 Ekko is of average height with a wiry, slightly athletic build. His skin is a rich dark brown, contrasting sharply with his thick white colored, slightly curly hair. He styles his hair usually smoothed backward and slicked slightly, and up in a small bun on top of the back of his head, heavily different than his hairstyle in the other universe 
 His eyes are dark brown, still a bit soft and round but they carry a heavier, more tired look. His eyebrows are straight but slightly curved upwards, and his wide nose complements his defined facial structure. 
 Also, unlike his alternate version, he wears a few good colored earrings.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Trivia [ ] 
 It's implied that Ekko being taken over by alternate versions of himself is a common occurrence as  Powder  mentions that Ekko is having ""another identity crisis again"" when the main timeline  Ekko  first arrived in his counterpart's body and later when he returns to his own  universe , Powder doesn't react with any sadness or surprise hinting that something like this had happened before.

 History [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 As the assistant of one of  Piltover 's  Council , Elora handled many of Mel's communications with her business and political associates. [1]  Due to this and how closely together they work, Elora is made privy to at least some of Mel's grander plans. [2] [3] [4]  She is also at least somewhat familiar with her origins. [4] [5] 
 
 Biography [ ] 
 Early Life [ ] 
 Elora's early life is largely left open to speculation, although it can be assumed she was a long-time assistant to Mel due to their close friendship. It is suggested that Elora was from  Noxus  and potentially joined Mel in her exile at the hands of  Ambessa Medarda . This is shown through  Ambessa 's recognition of Elora in ' Heavy Is the Crown ' (season 2).
 
 Mel's Informant [ ] 
 Elora acts as a means of communication between Mel and her associates, as well as her enemies and those she has suspicions of. Elora discusses  Jayce’ s trial with Mel in ' Some Mysteries Are Better Left Unsolved ', and expresses curiosity at Jayce's  Hextech  proposals. This is what eventually leads Mel to explore Jayce's technology as a means of improving  Piltover .
 In ' The Boy Savior ', Elora delivers a letter to Mel sealed with her family's emblem. This foreshadows the arrival of  Ambessa Medarda  and the Noxians to Piltover. 
 Elora was not present in the meeting room when  Jinx  bombed the council at the end of Season 1.
 
 Possession and Death [ ] 
 In Season 2, as Mel investigates the  Black Rose  in her study in Piltover, Elora confirms  Lest 's tip that  Salo  is arranging the meeting of several nobles under Ambessa's instructions. Following Jinx's paint attack on the city, Mel decides to use her  Shimmer  dart to kill Salo before he can instigate the meeting. However, Elora is suddenly paralysed; black roses grow from her face and her eyes turn red, suggesting that she has been possessed. The room fills with roses and both Elora and Mel disappear, abducted by the Black Rose.
 Some time passes until we see that Mel is imprisoned alongside her brother,  Kino Medarda , in the Black Rose's prison. Mel states that they 'killed her friend' and a flashback shows Elora being crushed into a black chasm-like line, seemingly dead. 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Elora presents herself as a calm and professional person who takes good initiative in her position as Mel's assistant. She is extremely loyal and an effective researcher, as shown in her knowledge of Jayce's trial and Salo's plan. She is softly spoken and appears gentle.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Elora is a tall and slim woman of around 30. She dresses in simple yet elegant and professional clothing, typically wearing white that symbolises innocence and purity. She can be seen wearing traditional Noxian colours and patterns in Season 2, suggesting she has connections to the empire. 
She has a signature hairstyle consisting of two buns and a middle part. A silhouette of this hairstyle can be seen after her death in the final episode of the show, potentially suggesting that she is still alive or an important figure in Mel's memory. 
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Research : Elora is an effective researcher who appears to have good connections within Piltover and is able to gather reliable information for Mel. 
 
 
 Trivia [ ] 
 Elora's voice actress,  Erica Lindbeck , also voices the  Black Rose Spy  in  Legends of Runeterra .

 Biography [ ] 
 The princess was an enemy of Noxus, and was captured by  Ambessa Medarda . She was brought to  Mel Medarda  to be given a sentence, but Ambessa disagreed with her daughter’s choice in peace and killed the foreign princess.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Appearance [ ] 
 The princess has fair skin, black hair, and green eyes. She wears a dark teal robe with a brown leather belt, undershirt, and pants. She wears a light blue skirt along with a green, red, and white beaded necklace affiliated with the Black Rose.
 
 Trivia [ ] 
 She is an ally of the Black Rose, seen when the  Illusionary Sorceress  gives Mel the foreign princess' necklace to Mel as a symbol that she had joined the group. Ambessa also recognizes the necklace as property of the Black Rose in the  series finale . 
 Despite being a member of the  Black Rose , the Foreign Princess is never seen using magic at any point making it ambiguous as to whether or not she's a Mage.

 Biography [ ] 
 Stillwater [ ] 
 Gert is one of many Jinxers that were arrested at the Vander Statue and taken to  Stillwater Hold . When  Jinx  and  Sevika  break into the prison to save them, Gert touches Jinx’s shoulder in a comforting way. The other Jinxers follow her in suit as they leave the prison. This leaves a lasting effect on Jinx as she realizes the people of Zaun believe in her, and see her as a symbol.
 
 The Noxus and Piltover Battle [ ] 
 Gert and some other Zaunites join forces with the uppercity to help fight in the battle between them and  Ambessa ’s forces. Somewhere during the fight she is injured and  Vi  carries her between fights to another building, where she then dies.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Through her few scenes, Gert appears to be a strong-willed and determined person. She participates in revolts against the uppercity as well as being apart of the Jinxers. In the end, she chose to help others in the fight against Ambessa and  Viktor  and died for it.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Gert is muscular and stocky, a similar body type to Vi. She has warm brown skin that’s littered with freckles. She has a scar on her upper lip, two silver bolt-like eyebrow piercings, and blue side-swept dreadlocks. She wears blue and pink eyeliner in honor of Jinx, and dark purple lipstick.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 Grayson is from  Piltover . At some point in her life, she became an Enforcer to protect the city and bring justice. She was a Kiramman family friend and has known  Caitlyn  since she was very young. Grayson participated in a shooting competition, which Caitlyn won, but she found out Grayson held back and shot later. After this, during a cocktail made by the Kirammans to celebrate Caitlyn's victory, Grayson was outside relaxing when Caitlyn approached and asked if her parents paid her to let her win, something Grayson denied. She said to the girl that she thought she deserved to win. Then, with honesty, Grayson said that as an Enforcer, how she uses her weapon helps protect others and bring justice and that it's trophy enough for her. She asked Caitlyn what she was shooting for. Somewhere before season 1, Grayson became Sheriff of the Piltover Enforcers, and she made a deal with  Vander . She would keep her people out of his streets, and he would do the same. [1] 
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 After  Vi  and her siblings had caused a stir in  Piltover , Greyson was sent to  Zaun  to find the people responsible. She went to talk with Vander inside  Benzo 's shop in the company of  Marcus . The people from the topside wanted to blame someone for the explosion caused by the people of Zaun. Greyson reminded Vander of their deal, but he was unwilling to give her any names. Accepting her defeat in this matter, Greyson left the shop, but not before giving Vander a way to contact her if he changed his mind. [1] 
 Inside  Jayce's  ruined workshop, Grayson interviews a perturbed Jayce who understands that his workshop was broken into and destroyed. However, she points out that most of Jayce's possessions don't have permits for them.  Viktor , who was also there, asked what had happened there, and Jayce answered with a scoff, ""Science"", but Grayson mentioned that it doesn't give the right to have illegal equipment. Viktor then uses his authority to have Jayce arrested for possessing illegal equipment. [2] 
 Eventually, Grayson leads Jayce to the  Piltover Council  chambers, where his trial will be held. [2] 
 Sometime after the trial, Grayson reports to the Council about the investigation surrounding the thieves who stole from Jayce's workshop. However, Council members  Torman Hoskel  and  Salo  scorn Grayson's progress, citing its inadequacies in figuring out who did it. Grayson's partner,  Marcus , speaks up and claims they'll find them. Chiming in, Grayson cites they've conducted thorough searches and interviews of the people down in the  Zaun . However,  Irius Bolbok  demands that more affirmative action be done, even if it means turning the Zaun upside down. [2] 
 On the day of Vander's arrest, she, alongside Marcus, enters  Benzo 's pawnshop to apprehend Vander, but as they leave, she's killed by  an unknown assailiant . [3] 
 A flashback depicts Grayson in a snowy forest competing against Caitlyn to see who could shoot a wooden target first, and Caitlyn wins. They later attend a party held by Caitlyn's parents, and the two enjoy where it is being held. Caitlyn confronts Grayson over whether or not her parents paid her to let her win, which Grayson playfully claims was a serious accusation. However, Caitlyn accuses Grayson of holding back, but Grayson brushes it off, stating Caitlyn earned her trophy. Still, Caitlyn insists on an answer, and Grayson denies being paid to allow her to win. Grayson says that her true trophy is protecting the city as an Enforcer and asks what Caitlyn is aiming for herself. [4] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Grayson is shown to be calm and soft-spoken.

 Grayson is a stocky tan-skinned woman with greying black hair and blue eyes. She has an angular nose, sharp cheekbones, and hooded eyes. Grayson wears her hair in a short middle cut.

 Biography [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Sometime before the  first episode , Huck makes a deal to do something for two gangsters. They meet in  The Last Drop  for payment, but the gangsters are unwilling to pay the agreed-upon price. This is where  Vander  steps in and ensures that Huck is treated fairly. [1] 
 Huck appears sitting in a corner, listening to the debate between Vander and  Sevika  about how to approach the  Enforcers  from  Piltover . [2] 
 Huck is not seen again for about  seven years . Later on, he is seen approaching  Caitlyn Kiramman , asking about  Vi’s  well-being, saying she is an old friend as  her dad  saved his life. [3]  Caitlyn asks Huck for a doctor, and Huck informs her that it is very hard to come by down below, but he informs her of a potion maker who helps with ailments, especially those related to Shimmer usage. He takes her to the potion maker, and as the potion maker passes the potion laced with Shimmer to Caitlyn, there is a brief glimpse of Huck staring at the Shimmer potion and craving it. Caitlyn offers Huck to come see Vi, but he declines as he doesn't want her to see him like this. Caitlyn hugs him to thank him, and she leaves him.
 He is then seen with the other addicts taking Shimmer from  Silco , with the implication being that he had told Silco where Caitlyn and Vi were hiding.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Huck can be timid, but when it comes to being scorned or slighted in any way, he's known to lash out when he is in the right.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 When you first meet Huck, he is a slender man sporting brown hair tied back into a ponytail and glasses. The last time we see him, due to his excessive usage of Shimmer. He has become more slender, with hollowed-out cheekbones, and his glasses appear to be broken. Instead of brown eyes, his eyes have turned pink from his excessive Shimmer usage, along with purple veins appearing around them. One of his most prominent features is the purple tumors protruding out of his head from his overuse of Shimmer.  
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 After being ""healed"" he is part of the hivemind of Viktor's Commune and is able to be controlled by Viktor.
 
 Trivia [ ] 
 After Viktor healed Huck, he no longer needed his glasses to see.

 History [ ] 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 The Illusionary Sorceress kidnaps both  Elora  and  Mel Medarda  and ends up killing Elora. She takes Mel to a captive holding cell in the hopes of awakening her powers, where she takes the form of her  brother  to deceive her. She tells Mel about Ambessa's affair, and how one of the two of them is the affair child. As time goes on, though, Mel figures out that it isn't actually her brother she is talking to, but the Sorceress. The Sorceress restrains Mel in a cosmic realm, where Mel's mage powers awaken, and she breaks out of the restraints.
 When Mel comes to, the Sorceress tells Mel about her powers. She then successfully recruits the mage into the Black Rose.
 Later, when Mel betrays her mother, the Sorceress takes Ambessa to the cosmic realms and uses her powers to kill the warlord. Mel then uses her own powers to attack the Sorceress seemingly destroying her.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 The Illusionary Sorceress is a cunning, sly, and manipulative being. She uses others to get an advantage against her enemy and kills without mercy. 
 She appears to view all other mages within the Black Rose in a familial light referring to Mel as her ""sister"". It's unknown if this sentiment extends to any and all mages outside the Black Rose as well.  
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Her main form consists of a black ghastly body, with a black head piece and piercing orange eyes, underneath her eyes is a stripe of pale yellow. Her form extends to a long black skirt that has black cloud-tendrils seeping out of it. Her fingers are the only exposed body part, being fair-colored.
 When taking the form of another person, she has piercing orange eyes in their body.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Shapeshifting : The Sorceress has the ability to take any being's form.

 Biography [ ] 
 History [ ] 
 At one point, Bolbok's race was almost annihilated by what he deemed to be warmongering  mages . [1] 
 At some point, Bolbok was badly injured in an unknown incident which resulted in nearly 95% of his biological body being destroyed forcing him to replace it with cybernetics. 
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 When the workshop of an Academy scholar named  Jayce Talis  was robbed and accidentally blown up, his unauthorized experimentation with exploiting magic crystals was discovered, becoming a cause for concern of the Council. Bolbok moved for Jayce's banishment as stated in their Ethos, but  Heimerdinger  instead moved for him to be expelled from the Academy and banned from his research instead. [1]  With  Councilor Medarda's  machinations, however, Jayce and his new partner  Viktor  managed to perfect Jayce's  Hextech  research. He was given the authority to work on it. [2]  Bolbok eventually became one of the many businessmen in Piltover to benefit from Jayce's creation of  Hexgates .
 At one point, newly appointed Councilor Jayce ordered strengthening security and inspection of trades made through the Hexgates. As Bolbok and his associates had dealt with  enforcers  and the rest of the Council to ease their transactions, despite possibly shady dealings, Bolbok and the others began discussing alternatives or what to do about Jayce. Jayce managed to win back their favor soon after with deals of his own. [3]  With this, Bolbok and the rest of the Council were easily convinced to agree with Jayce's suggestion to force Heimerdinger to retire from the Council. [4] 
 When an explosion on the bridge caused by a  Zaunite  resulted in the deaths of multiple enforcers, and their  Sheriff's  deceit was discovered, the Council convened to discuss their next action.  Councilor Kiramman's  daughter  Caitlyn  arrived to address them and told them about  Silco . Though Bolbok quickly shot down her statements as baseless due to prior investigations yielding no results, Caitlyn proved her point by pointing out that the investigations were led by their corrupt late Sheriff. [5]  Jayce later came to their next meeting with the proposition to grant Zaun their independence. After some discussion and objections, the Council unanimously agreed, only for the meeting to be bombed by  Jinx  with a missile powered by Jayce's Hextech Gemstone. [6] 
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Along with two others, Bolbok died during this incident. [7]

 Biography [ ] 
 Meeting Jinx [ ] 
 Isha meets Jinx  while running away from Zaunite goons, who are chasing her down for unspecified reasons. After jumping across the end of a broken pipe, she eventually loses her grip and falls down, landing on a cloaked figure and knocking them both down. The goons eventually surround them until the figure removes the hood to reveal Jinx, shocking and catching the goons off guard. Jinx rapidly pulls out her handgun and subsequently shoots them all — saving Isha.
 Jinx makes small talk to Isha before concealing herself again with her hood and walking away. Isha, having nowhere to go, follows behind.
 
 Sacrifice [ ] 
 As Jinx tries to communicate with an enraged Vander, the towering beast swipes her away, launching her off her feet. Isha watches on, petrified and conflicted as the scene unfolds in front of her: the sight of Jinx writhing in pain, Vander battling with the Noxian soldiers, and an injured  Vi  being supported by  Caitlyn . A newfound determination awakening within her, she takes a  Hextech   Gemstone  that was stored in her pouch and heads toward the scuffle as memories of her time together with Jinx flashes through her mind as she ran, tears flying off as she holds the gemstone close and presses on. Leaping off a shield, she lands near Jinx's handgun lying by the dirt and grabs it as she slides across the ground, passing by Jinx on the way.
 Isha overloads the handgun with two more gemstones, amplifying its firepower. Realizing what Isha is doing, Jinx is alarmed and stumbles as she tries to chase after her, calling to her before Vi stops her. Isha momentarily halts underneath Vander, meeting Jinx's gaze. With tears in her eyes, she does a finger gun before pointing the pulsating handgun up towards Vander. Closing her eyes, she pulls the trigger, causing the surrounding area to burst into a blinding explosion of arcane magic, killing both herself and Vander.
 
 Legacy [ ] 
 Isha’s death deeply affects Jinx, causing her to  turn herself in  to Caitlyn. Jinx ends up very depressed and takes her braids out, leaving her long hair loose, later chopping it off to shoulder length.
 Isha’s death may have been what caused Jinx to  sacrifice herself  to protect Vi, the only family she had left.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Isha appears to be a bold child, almost instantly bonding with Jinx after Jinx kills the mobsters that were chasing her. She grows fond of Jinx, as seen in  Episode 3  where she interposes between Jinx and Vi, saving the former from getting killed by pointing Jinx’s handgun at Vi’s face.
 Although having witnessed numerous acts of violence and deaths, most of them by Jinx's hands, she doesn't seem to be affected by it, enjoying the chaos that comes with them.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Isha is a thin, brown haired child with amber eyes. In  Episode 4  she gets her hair dyed blue, and appears to have drawn numerous sketches and scribbles over her clothes. She's often seen wearing a safari-like hat with goggles, also covered with sketches from Episode 4 onwards.

 Trivia [ ] 
 She's seen carrying a spyglass and sometimes a shovel. 
 She is non-verbal, as proven by the fact that she never speaks a word, but only makes simple vocal sounds, and that she uses some sort of sign language with Jinx in episode 4. 
 Isha’s theme song is entirely in Chinese. 
 Her goggles and hat resemble that of  Teemo . 
 The name Isha translates to “one who protects” in Hindi, and “life” in Arabic. 
 Some viewers point out that during the  prison break , Isha makes a sound similar to the scream ""Mama"". It is difficult to confirm or deny this information, because this action is subtitled ""Scream"".

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 
 When Jayce was young, he and  his mother  got caught in a snowstorm, seemingly with no one around for miles. Just when his mother collapsed, a  cloaked man  arrived who used  magic  to warp them a safe distance away from the blizzard. The man left Jayce the crystal he'd used for his spell. This encounter shaped young Jayce's desire to learn more about magic and conduct research to harness magic through science later in his life. [2] 
 Being part of House Talis, a family of renowned toolmakers most known for their hammers and the collapsible pocket wrench, most expected Jayce to join their family business. [2] [3]  Jayce, however, was determined in his research into science and the  Arcane . Eventually, he became a scholar at the Academy in Piltover, where he was favored by the Dean and the Head of the Council, Professor  Heimerdinger , and by the Kirammans, who saw his ambition and decided to support him as his patron. [2] 
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Act 1 [ ] 
 Sometime after buying supplies from  Benzo's  in  the Lanes , [4] [2]  Jayce returned to his workshop just in time for him to realize that it had been broken into.  One  of the children inside accidentally dropped one of his many unstable crystals and caused an explosion. This alerted Heimerdinger, the authorities, and the Council of his unauthorized research, and he was put on trial in front of the Council.
 Despite Heimerdinger's suggestion, Jayce told the Council about his research being for harnessing magic through science, invoking fear among the Council of the dangers of unchecked magic in the hands of those with no innate Arcane talent. Councilor  Bolbok  moved to have Jayce exiled, after which  Jayce's mother  stepped forward and pled his case. Heimerdinger allowed it and instead asked the Council for a more lenient punishment—Jayce's expulsion from the Academy.  Councilor Kiramman  turned her back on Jayce. However, their daughter  Caitlyn  maintained her belief in him, and he was resigned to the idea that he would have to follow in his father's footsteps after all.
 
 
 That research is everything. My… my whole life.
 
 Jayce, "" The Base Violence Necessary for Change "" 
 
 To Jayce, his punishment was worse than death, to the point where he contemplated jumping off of his former workshop's building before he was stopped by Viktor, the Dean's assistant, who decided to help him with his research. [2]  With Viktor's advice, Jayce realized how he could stabilize the crystals. Racing against time to prove the efficacy of his research the day before his equipment is scheduled to be destroyed, Viktor helped him break into Heimerdinger's laboratory to reclaim his crystals and test their theory.
 
 
 Their attempts with their new calculations caused bright lights and a minor explosion that caught the attention of Heimerdinger and the enforcers. Still, by the time they'd forced their way into the laboratory, the crystal had stabilized, with Jayce, Viktor, and other objects around them floating in the air with the crystal. Though Heimerdinger was impressed, he was still conflicted about embracing it due to the risks it posed, but the ambitious  Councilor Medarda  arrived and proclaimed that they should bring it to the Council. [5] 
 
 Act 2 [ ] 
 Mel Medarda Perhaps it's time. For the era of  magic . Jayce Uh,  Hextech . For the era of Hextech. — "" The Base Violence Necessary for Change "" 
 Jayce eventually earned the support of the other Councilors. Years later, Jayce met the Council's conditions to allow him and Viktor to continue their research—they further stabilized the crystal and created Hexgates that revolutionized trade and transportation for Piltover and the world, putting Piltover on the map as the global shipping lane. He and Viktor hoped to present their latest findings where their stable  Hextech  Gemstone could be used to power tools to make work easier for their laborers. Though impressed, Heimerdinger advised the two that they needed more time to ensure its safety.
 For Progress Day, the Council had Jayce give the speech addressing the attendees, an honor usually only done by Heimerdinger. Before the end of the day,  a Zaunite  stole the Gemstone; in fear of the thief potentially weaponizing it, Jayce suggested to the Council that they shut down all Hextech operations, worrying the Councilors who had business dependent on the gates.  Mel  then recommended that Jayce be instated as a Council member to serve his goal of safeguarding the Hexgates better and thus all matters dependent on it—a radical suggestion since the Council has traditionally only held seven seats. With Heimerdinger's agreement, the rest of the Council followed, and Jayce became the eighth Councilor. [3]

 Act 3 [ ] 
 [8] 
 [9] 
 [10] 
 
 Fate [ ] 
 Despite his body being physically destroyed, it's unknown if he is alive or dead as it can be presumed that he and Viktor were banished into the Spectral Reality. 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Jayce is an ambitious, somewhat gullible (in earlier episodes), and creative person. In Act 1 of Season 1, he has a dream for  Hextech  and is confident in its potential. He has a passion for his invention and when he and Viktor successfully harness the Hex crystal, we see a child-like happiness from Jayce.
 Later in Season 1, he becomes less gullible as he makes his way up to be the de-facto leader of The Council. He is more strong-willed with his decisions in politics. We also see his caring side when Viktor grows more sick, and he leaves Mel’s bedside to be with him.
 In Season 2 he leaves behind his occupation as a Council member to pursue his and Viktor’s true dream for Hextech. He acted upon his emotions to save Viktor; by fusing him with the  Hexcore  to revive him. When Viktor leaves he becomes even more emotional, sleeping in the lab in hopes he would return.
 In the Arcane, Jayce grows paranoid and aggressive. Between seeing hallucinations of Mel and Viktor,  Viktor’s Soldiers , the pain of his broken leg, etc., he comes back to the normal universe with a strong passion to kill Viktor in hopes of saving everyone. He is aggressive in his actions, but only from his paranoia of the Soldiers and his experiences in the Arcane.
 In Act 3, he is slightly less paranoid but still strong-willed about ending Viktor. In the Cosmic Realm where he talks to Viktor, he shows his true compassion for his partner. He says that Viktor’s “imperfections” were apart of what made Jayce admire him. In the end, he chooses to sacrifice himself to aid Viktor in ending the magic.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Jayce has a muscular build with tan skin. He has short dark brown hair with shaved sides. In Act 1, he wears his academy outfit that consists of a maroon dress shirt, white and blue vest, red necktie, and black pants. In the rest of the season, he wears a white and gold jacket with dark red shoulder pads that contain the Talis family crest. He has dark red pants and black boots.
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 While stuck in the Arcane, Jayce becomes disheveled and dirty. His hair grows out into a middle part, and he grows a beard. His regular outfit is now un-buttoned; revealing a grey shirt underneath. His lips are chapped and scarred, and the Rune he had on his bracelet is now fused into his wrist. He disassembled his  hammer  to build a brace for his left leg.
 Later on in the season, he cleans himself up and wears a black dress shirt and white jacket. He has brown gloves, large black and gold shoulder pads, and other gold detailing on his jacket.
 In his Astral form, his body and hair change colors. His body is typically white, teal, pink, purple, and blue, while his hair is typically white or other colors his body shifts to. His face and hands remain his normal skin color, but with the edition of Viktor’s fingerprint on his forehead that are an array of iridescent colors (normally purple).
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Ingenuity:  Jayce can create many different inventions with passion. Such as his  Mercury Hammer ,  Atlas Gauntlets , and  Hexgates   (with Viktor's help) 
 Durability:  He is able to survive for an extended period of time in a deserted cave and leg injury. 
 Strength:  Jayce is physically strong, as we see in the forge as well as his ability to use the Mercury Hammer. 
 Trivia [ ] 
 In the Alternate Universe, it's been theorized that due to his explosion causing Vi to die, Viktor never came to partner with him and in term, nobody was there to stop him from committing suicide. 
 According to Christian Linke, one of the co-creators of Arcane, he confirmed that both Jayce and Viktor are dead.

 Biography 
 Early life 
 Powder was born to  Felicia  and  Connol , she was the younger sister of  Violet . Growing up, Powder had a good relationship with Vi and her parents. However, when her parents died during a battle on the bridge between  Piltover  and  Zaun , she and Vi were the only people left in their family. After the battle, Vander found the two siblings where he adopted them and raised them as his own, alongside  Mylo  and  Claggor . [1] 
 
 The heist 
 A few years later, Vi, Powder, Claggor, and Mylo venture into Piltover after getting a tip from  Ekko  regarding a Piltover citizen whom he had followed after he shopped at  Benzo 's. After finding the apartment, the kids looted the place where Powder discovers a box full of blue  crystals . However, Vi hears  Jayce  and  Caitlyn 's footsteps. This makes Vi signal everyone to leave. But in the rush, Powder drops one of the blue crystals, setting off an explosion that blows up half the building. This notifies the enforcers and sends the kids on a chase through Piltover. 
 
 The aftermath 
 After the kids evade the enforcers, they return to Zaun with their stolen goods. They are stopped by a street gang led by  Deckard , who demands they hand the bag over. Not willing to go down without a fight, Vi, Claggor, and Mylo take on the rival gang and leave the goods with Powder. Midway, Powder is chased by one of the gang members who notices the stolen supplies. She is cornered at the docks, where she tries to attack him with Mouser, though it sputters out and fails. Left with no other option, she throws the goods away, Which Accidentally lands in the ocean as Powder manages to escape for good. 
 Later, Mylo yells at Powder for losing the stolen goods and claims, ""She jinxes every job,"" though Vi silences him. Back at The Last Drop, Vander reprimands the group for the trouble they caused in Piltover while Vi argues back, claiming that Piltover has plenty while they have nothing. [1] 
 
 Laying low 
 To lay low, the group decides to hide in a run-down arcade. Mylo berates Powder for being unable to fix a target practice range; instead, she shows him how to activate it and plays the range herself, showing Her excellent aim. Enforcers soon break into the arcade, and they run away once more with the help of Ekko.
 Later, several Zaunites gather at the Last Drop, and the group, including Powder, stands by a corner. They watch as several residents, including Sevika, claim they want to fight back, but Vander reminds them that violence is not the answer and that they ""just have to stand together"". The kids wonder why Vander still chooses peace, and Ekko informs them that Vander has a deal with the enforcers.
 While lounging in the basement of the Last Drop, Vander signals the group that enforcers have arrived again. They hide in the rafters, but Powder struggles to hang on; luckily, she manages to keep from falling, and only after the enforcer leaves the basement does she let go. She decides to make more bombs, naming one ""Whisker,"" and she shows them to Vi, who encourages her.
 
 Rescuing Vander 
 When Vi returns to the Last Drop, letting the group know what she saw, they begin to plan a rescue for Vander. Powder insists on joining, but Vi warns her not to and leaves her alone with a flare instead. Powder breaks down afterward; in her breakdown, the Hextech crystals she'd swiped from the penthouse spill out of her bag, and she realizes that those caused the explosion. 
 She makes her way to the docks with a monkey bomb loaded with crystals. She drops the monkey through the window, and explosions are set off, killing Mylo and Claggor alongside several of Silco's goons; Vi and Vander are injured,  Sevika  loses an arm protecting  Silco , and  Singed 's lab blows up with him inside. Powder makes her way to the entrance, only to find Vander dead and Vi extremely anguished, and in that anguish, she angrily calls her a ""jinx"" and leaves her sobbing.
 With no one left, Powder is adopted by Silco. [2] 
 
 Progress day 
 During Piltover's day of celebration, a shipment of  shimmer  is ambushed by  the Firelights , a rebel undercity group, and Powder, having evidently gone insane and now known as Jinx, fighting back mercilessly with her now very effective explosives. Now deadly in combat, she easily takes down multiple Firelights until one of them is unmasked, and her pink hair triggers a hallucination, confusing Jinx with a false image of Vi, causing her to freeze before she realizes it isn't her sister and heartlessly shooting the girl without hesitation. The remaining firelights flee, and she fires on them, putting the rest of her own crew in harm's way. 
 Jinx remains with Silco. The two have formed a father-daughter relationship, albeit an unhealthy one. Silco encourages her to work on her inventions, excuses her blunders, and genuinely cares for her. Her hideout, built over the fissures, allows her time to perfect her explosives, but also shows how trapped by her own memories she is, showing that she kept Vi's rabbit and even made a copy, one in a box and the other nailed to the wall above her desk, along with Claggor's glasses and a life-size doll of Mylo, who appears to her in frequent hallucinations. 
 After her explosive reaction at the shimmer shipment, Silco suggests she take time to collect herself, frustrating her. In an effort to prove herself, she breaks into the  Piltover Council  building, stealing a  hextech  crystal and creating a diversion by starting a fire in a pavilion to lure enforcers into a trap filled with explosives, which kills six enforcers and injures a seventh.
 Despite Silco's initial frustration, the benefits the crystal promises outweigh the risks to his business, and he is quick to forgive.
 
 Searching for Vi 
 When she finds out from Sevika that her sister is alive and in the lanes searching for her, she uses the flare Vi had given her in an attempt to find her. Despite her doubts, Vi shows up, and the pair are reunited. When Caitlyn appears, Jinx turns on the pair, questioning Vi's motivation for returning until the Firelights ambush the trio, and a fight ensues, leading to Vi and Caitlyn being taken and Jinx being left alone yet again.
 
 The Boy Savior 
 Searching for both Vi and the hextech gemstone, Jinx watches from on high as her swarm of mechanical butterflies explodes across a barricaded bridge topside, killing the team of enforcers, including Marcus. Jinx comes face to face with her sister and Caitlyn and fires at them from almost point-blank range, stopped by Ekko intercepting and knocking her back. Ekko faces off against Jinx, allowing Cait and Vi to escape while the two fight. Despite the pair being evenly matched, Ekko pins her down, and Jinx lets off a grenade, dislocating Ekko's leg and nearly killing her. Silco carries the severely injured Jinx to Singed, begging him to save her. The doctor injects her with shimmer, enhancing her strength and speed and ultimately saving her despite the demanding and extremely painful process.
 
 The Tea Party 
 Jinx knocks out and captures Vi, bringing her to what remains of the warehouse where the events of  episode 3  took place, and reveals she has set up a twisted tea party, with Caitlyn and Silco both tied up and gagged at the table. Jinx begs Vi to kill Caitlyn, which she refuses, and Jinx turns on Caitlyn herself, sparing her only because of Vi's pleas, leading to Cait firing on her, and Jinx retaliates by knocking her out. Silco and Vi each try to convince her to either spare or kill Caitlyn, and in her overwhelm, she shoots and kills Silco. Breaking down at her own actions, she takes fishbones, powered by the hextech gemstone, and fires a missile at the Piltover council; leading to the death of 3 councillors - the most being notable is  Cassandra Kiramman ,  Irius Bolbok  and  Torman Hoskel .
 
 Fate 
 At the end of Season 2, Jinx falls down the Piltovan Hexgate alongside Warwick in an effort to blow him up and sacrifice herself so that Vi can live her life.
 
 Characteristics 
 Personality 
 As a little girl, Powder was shy and sweet, but clumsy and prone to making mistakes. This, paired with a case of middle child syndrome, sparked irritation from her older ""brother"" Mylo, who referred to her as a jinx. She greatly admired her older sister Vi (her only biological family) and saw her as a role model and an almost parental figure. While not as physically capable as Vi, she was very creative and spent much of her spare time making different kinds of inventions, mostly bombs and other small explosives. However, they were predictably unreliable and were only effective later in her teens. She showed how skilled she was with a gun, beating her best friend, Ekko, and her brother, Mylo, on various occasions. Despite her general timid, quiet nature, Powder was shown on multiple occasions to have extremely strong emotional reactions, especially when faced with the possibility of abandonment, screaming, and crying with accompanying hallucinations and self-harming behavior, something her character retains later in the series.
 After witnessing the death of her family and her sister's abandonment, Powder adopted the identity of Jinx. Jinx is incredibly mentally unstable and has become unpredictable and remorseless as a teen, showing no mercy towards her opponents or anything she perceives as a threat. She is incredibly smart, both in her combat and her weapon-making abilities. Like her younger self, Jinx has extremely strong emotions, only strengthened by her guilt, which she copes with using violence and often self-harm. Despite her outward appearance of a ""manic pixie nightmare girl"", her innocent, bubbly attitude is a conscious front used to manipulate the people around her. Along with her wild, ruthless nature, we also see her being vulnerable and childlike in her actions, a contrast between Jinx and Powder, who are separate identities (as a result of both her childhood trauma and likely Borderline Personality Disorder), and we see many times where her actions remind us she is a child trapped in the body of a teen. She is left alone to deal with her guilt from the traumatic events leading to the deaths of her brothers and Vander and her resentment towards Vi, who she believes abandoned her, something drilled into her by Silco to cement her loyalty to him. 
 
 Appearance 
 Jinx is rather pale, which could be attributed to the lack of sunlight in the lanes, as her skin was rosier when she was Powder. She also has slightly sharp, sickly facial features. There are constant dark circles under her eyes, noticeable tear burns, and dull purple lips. Her eyes are a silvery powder blue with darker flecks. However, they change to a pink/red violet hue due to shimmer that is seen for the first time at the end of  episode 8 . Her eyes briefly change shades depending on which side of her is out, and while witnessing the presumed death of  Isha , her eyes briefly turn their normal color again. 
 Her bright blue hair is styled in two long blue braids with a sharp side bang styled on her left. The braids fall down her back and reach her ankles; both braids are decorated with bullet casings in both silver and gold and engraved with her drawings. She has a widow's peak and a few short strands of hair hanging loosely around her face.
 Jinx has tattoos on the right side of her body, depicting clouds similar to the ones caused by both the warehouse explosion in  episode 3  and also the flare that is given to her by Vi, which she uses in  episode 6 . The tattoos are drawn in pale blue, with darker blue outlines, and cover her arm, shoulder, and stomach on the right-hand side. After her transformation from the shimmer, the tattoos are faded and scarred from the injection and her body's reaction to the drug.
 Her attire consists of a dark brown leather crop top with a piece of thin off-white cloth running through four eyelets to form an x in the center of her chest. The front and back of the crop top are connected at the base with a thin belt and at the top with a circular neckline that splits into a choker. She wears low-waisted, vertically striped pants in shades of purple/pink, torn unevenly at the bottom and shorter on the right side. She also wears arm warmers, one black and the other black on the upper half, while the lower half matches the pink/purple of her pants. Additionally, she has a studded belt of three individual sections: the one around her waist, the two that loop from the back to connect to the belt on the right side, and the hem of her pants on the left. She also has a pocket on her right hip for explosives and a gun holster on her left. She is seen wearing a large band-aid on her upper left calf, which covers the wound she is seen patching herself with a staple gun in  episode 7 . Finally, she wears a pair of loose, worn combat boots to which she's added magenta laces and extra metal elements on the toes and heels, both silver and gold.
 Jinx is also assumed to be ambidextrous. She prefers to shoot with her left hand but also uses her right hand as a seemingly dominant hand in many other scenes.
 As a child, her blue hair was shorter and styled in a single braid that fell just below her shoulders, and roughly chopped, chin-length bangs held in place with a collection of small metal hair clips. Her attire consisted of a dark blue shirt (which seems to be her shirt from when she was a baby presented at the start of  episode 1  over a pink/purple T-shirt with darker vertical stripes (the same fabric as her pants in the later episodes), brown shorts over purple leggings and brown ankle boots. She wears a blue skirt with a wide section in the front, a belt and pockets for bombs and extra parts, and dark arm and leg warmers.
 
 Abilities 
 Accuracy : Jinx is seen to be an excellent shot. She can outshoot Mylo in the training simulator and beat Ekko when the two played together. She tends to prefer handguns such as pistols but is also seen using a type of Gatling gun. 
 Inventions : while she was under the name of Powder, she struggled with building working inventions. As she grew older, she became more adept at inventing weaponry, specifically bombs. It's implied that she made most of the weapons used by Silco's gang. [3] 
 Shimmer Enhanced Physicality : Thanks to the use of Shimmer, Jinx is now far stronger, faster, and more agile than any regular human at the cost of her already shaky mental health. It especially affects her speed, allowing her to use flash step to dodge attacks in battle. 
 Trivia 
 Jinx has an unspecified mental illness and trauma disorder. She feels trapped in a world distorted by her anxieties, which causes her to become irrational, amplified by Silco’s influence.
 Jinx is popularly assumed to suffer from borderline personality disorder (BPD) by the community. BPD is a disorder characterized by a great fear of abandonment, intense and unstable emotions, erratic and impulsive behavior, and paranoia, and it can also lead to psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. 
 Jinx suffers from PTSD from the event that killed her family and her sister abandoning her. Alongside this, she experiences survivor's guilt. These traumas have greatly amplified her struggles and likely are the main cause of her psychosis. 
 Despite the fall and explosion at the end, the series gives several clear hints that she is alive:
 During the explosion, a purple stripe that moves from the explosion to the upper right side of the screen can be spotted. This purple stripe is similar to the effect when Jinx speeds up using Shimmer. When viewing the scene frame-by-frame, it is perfectly visible that this strip starts on the right side of the explosion and continues to move to the upper right side of the screen during a large number of frames. This is not a light effect, because frame-by-frame viewing shows other lighting effects that differ in color palette, as well as appear and disappear in much fewer frames than this purple stripe, which indicates that the source of this purple stripe is a moving physical object, and not a simple flash of purple light. 
 Caitlin can be seen looking at the drawings of the Gate Tower while she holds in her hand the  head from the monkey grenade that Jinx detonated. While looking at the blueprints, Caitlin finds information about the air vents, one of which Jinx most likely escaped through. 
 Next, there is a hint that Jinx has flown out of Zaun. In the last frames, they show exactly the same airship that was shown in episode 1 of season 1. In episode 1 of season 1, Powder said that someday she would fly on the same airship. 
 A small hint is given in the form of a frame with the inscription The End in the art style of Jinx, appearing after the scene with the airship. 
 Jinx' eye color is called Violet Red with HEX code #C71585.

 Biography [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Jules sits beside  Vern  as he conducts a business transaction with Huck, who is upset about not being paid the ten thousand they agreed upon. After Huck's snit tossing the bag of money toward them, Jules pulls out her knife, plunges it into the table, and asks that Huck make a choice.
 They're then joined by  Vander , who, despite Vern asking him to leave, pulls himself a chair and advises Jules to be careful with her words as the bar patrons glare at her. Vern then calls Vander by his name and Jules by his title, ""Hound of the Underworld"". She follows up by saying that she expected someone younger, but Vern claims he'd expect them to respect their deals. This leads to Vander politely asking them to follow up with the deal they made with Huck, and they tacitly agree.
 Upon seeing  Vi  and her group enter the bar, Vander leaves the table.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Jules is a quiet, no-nonsense lady, but when triggered, she's not afraid to act with intimidation.

 Biography [ ] 
 Lest is a character created solely for  Arcane  and does not appear in  League of Legends . Due to her limited screentime, only so much can be derived about her character outside of the fact she has some connection/affiliation with  Mel Medarda . In “Finally Got the Name Right”, she is seen treating  Salo  with  Shimmer  in an attempt to heal his legs, before being dismissed by  Ambessa Medarda . 
 Later, she is seen giving Mel the information she overheard from Ambessa and Salo’s meeting, and providing Mel with the tool she needs to succeed before vanishing into thin air. In “ Paint the Town Blue ”, she is seen once again treating Salo with shimmer, where he then lashes out, demanding that he be treated more often. Lest pulls away, informing him of “someone who performs miracles”, referencing  Viktor . 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Lest has limited screentime, but is shown to be a versatile, adaptable woman. She primarily deals in illicit substances to the wealthy movers and shakers of Piltover, smoothly switching between different masks to survive and gain. While she is willing to provide information to Mel about Salo's use of shimmer, she puts her own survival ahead of any political plays, disgusted with the idea of being treated as an expendable pawn.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Lest is a cat-like humanoid with a clothing style inspired by a combination  Romani dress  and  early 20th century western glamor , used to evoke a  fortune teller  archetype. She is easily identified by her large ears, puffy coat, and unique, gravelly voice, as well as digitigrade feet.

 Lest was confirmed to be trans by Eve Lindley, Lest's original English voice actor. [1] [2] [3]

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 Nothing is known about his early life, but it is presumed that he became an Enforcer before the events of Season 2. 
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Loris was underneath a bundle of paper in the rain on the streets of  Piltover , where  Vi  came along and accidentally threw a bottle of alcohol at him. He got up and sat down beside her, asking if she lost someone in the attack too. The two spend the night talking and drinking together, becoming friends. The next morning, the two of them meet  Maddie Nolen  and  Steb . He later joins Vi at the Councilors Memorial, where an attack led by  Renni , along with several  Chem-Tanks , occurs. He used a large piece of metal to shield people during the attack. 
 Later in Act I, Loris joins  Caitlyn 's strike team, composed of himself, Caitlyn, Vi, Maddie, and Steb. The strike team is given the objective of going into  Zaun  to find  Jinx . After the briefing, Loris is equipped with a large shield. Later, he brings a Zaunite back to Piltover along with Maddie and Steb while Vi and Caitlyn continue the hunt for Jinx.  
 In  Episode 5 , he helps Vi while she is a pit fighter in the undercity. When she keeps drinking more and gets angrier, he begins to lose hope in helping her and leaves.
 In  Episode 8 , he tells Vi that Jinx turned herself in and that she was arrested, prompting Vi to go find Caitlyn. 
 In  Episode 9 , he works an intermodal container launcher. As he begins to launch a container, he gets shot by a Noxian archer multiple times, the third shot being fatal, as the arrow strikes him in the neck and he dies seconds later. 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Loris is a very protective man. He is seen using his shield to protect people multiple times, such as Steb during the  attack on the memorial . He can also be seen as a father figure, as he was there to help Vi while she  took up pit fighting  in Zaun.  
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Loris is a large male with tanned skin, eye bags, dark brown hair, slight graying in his mutton chops style beard, and a small goatee. He has a small braid in his front bangs, with a small blue bead at the end. Loris has golden brown eyes and a wide nose, sharing many similarities with  Vander . Loris is often seen wearing his Enforcer uniform or a plain outfit while helping Vi in the Undercity.
 
 Powers and Abilities [ ] 
 Loris carries a large shield during his time as an Enforcer. 
 
 Trivia [ ] 
 In the  series finale , Vi mistook him for Vander after she got knocked down by an explosion. 
 Loris and Vander have similar appearances.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 Maddie Nolen was born in Noxus, where she became indoctrinated into the Noxian beliefs from a young age. At some point, she joined  Ambessa Medarda's  forces, before being chosen as a sleeper agent and sent off to  Piltover  as a plant waiting to be activated should the need to seize control of the city ever arise. 
 Once in Piltover, Maddie enlisted in the  Piltover Police Department , eventually becoming an elite Enforcer. 
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Act 1 [ ] 
 Maddie first appears when she introduces herself to  Vi  after a night of drinking in the street with her new friend,  Loris . Vi assumes Maddie is there to be an aggressor, but she is surprised when Maddie compliments her and relays Caitlyn's positive opinions of her.  
 Maddie would later join Caitlyn’s strike team with Vi, Loris, and  Steb .  
 
 Act 2 [ ] 
 Maddie next appears lying in bed with Caitlyn, hinting that they had an intimate moment in the bedroom. [2]  She doesn’t say much besides trying to convince Cait to turn against Ambessa, but she does return when Caitlyn leaves a lamp in remembrance of  her mother  and the other deceased Council members.
 
 Act 3 [ ] 
 Maddie is going over battle plans with Caitlyn when Vi storms into the room, demanding to know where  Jinx  is. [3]  Caitlyn dismisses Maddie, asking her to go check on  her father .  
 During the final battle against Noxus, Maddie betrays Caitlyn by revealing her loyalty to Ambessa, hinting that she was a sleeper agent for Noxus. [3]  Maddie attempts to execute Caitlyn with a rifle shot to the neck, expressing little regret at doing so, but  Mel  deflects the bullet with a barrier spell, which deflects away from Caitlyn, eventually hitting Maddie in the head. Maddie falls onto Caitlyn’s shoulder face-first, then lands unmoving on the ground. Caitlyn then looks down at her former colleague’s body with a surprised and angry look on her face.  
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 
 I did appreciate your warmth. 
 —Maddie Nolen, to  Caitlyn Kiramman , "" The Dirt Under Your Nails "" 
 
 While undercover, Maddie's overall demeanor was perpetually optimistic and enthusiastic, radiating warmth and positivity wherever she goes. She is always ready with a smile and encouraging words and eager to learn and please her superiors, especially Caitlyn.
 However, this was all just a facade to cover up her true allegiances to  Noxus , and  Ambessa Medarda . After the truth is revealed, Maddie is shown to be cold and ruthless towards her former friends and allies having betrayed them all. She was also implied to be a sadist as she was prepared to shoot Caitlyn through the neck rather than her head ensuring that she would die a slow and painful death rather than a quick and painless one. 
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Maddie is a young woman in her early 20s with short, choppy orange hair that falls just past her chin, grey-blue eyes, and a spattering of freckles across her nose and cheeks. She has a heart-shaped face with naturally rosy cheeks and usually a warm smile. She usually wears her police uniform with pride, but while off-duty in Episode 4, she is seen in a white unbuttoned blouse. 
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Maddie is shown to be a talented sharpshooter. 
 
 Trivia [ ] 
 Before Season 2's release, fans noticed Maddie's strong physical resemblance to  Ren  and speculated that it might take place during or after a time skip.

 History [ ] 
 Marcus had always been overzealous in acting on his duties as an Enforcer.  He looked down on  Zaunites  in general and aggressively went after them. [2] [3]  When four children from the undercity caused an explosion in  Jayce 's workshop, Marcus joined Sheriff  Grayson  in investigating. They went to see  Vander , with whom Grayson had a deal to maintain the peace between their districts.  [2]  Marcus did not care about their deal; however, when pressured by the  Council , he tried to look for the children on his own, more so when the crime lord  Silco  approached him with a deal.
 Marcus went to  The Last Drop  and ordered his men to search the place. Grayson confronted him for this, and though she'd felt it was too late to stop their retaliation, they received the pneumatic tube capsule she'd given Vander.  Vi  tried to turn herself in,  [3]  only for Vander to stop her and surrender himself in her place. However, before they could return to the upper city, Silco had  Deckard  kill Grayson and  Benzo . Silco told Marcus that the terms of their deal had changed and threw him his money.
 After the deaths of  Claggor  and  Mylo , and the subsequent destruction of Silco’s  Shimmer  factory, Marcus kidnapped Vi after she left  Powder  with Vander’s body. [4]  Silco had expected, and possibly ordered, Marcus to kill Vi, but instead, Marcus threw her into  Stillwater Hold  without a trial or details of her crimes. [5]  Marcus had to bribe the Warden on at least one occasion to ensure Vi's stay in the prison. [1] 
 For years, Marcus kept up his dealings with Silco. He was also eventually promoted to Sheriff after Grayson’s death, making him even more useful to Silco. With his position, Marcus managed to aid Silco's business by letting his shipments through the  Hexgates  with no problems. He also interfered when other Enforcers tried to investigate Silco's dealings and shut them down. [6] [7]  Marcus also had deals with the merchants in the city, one that most members of the Council secretly sanctioned. [8] 
 He was not without his doubts about his deal with Silco, particularly when Silco's daughter  Jinx  caused the deaths of his officers. Once, he visited Grayson's crypt and remembered Grayson's time as Sheriff and how good the woman had been even telling his daughter that ""she was a great woman"". Nonetheless, Marcus toed the line between doing right by his men and having to work for Silco, now needing to find someone to answer for the explosion as Silco would be unwilling to give up his daughter. Silco told Marcus to pin the explosion on  the Firelights . For a moment, Marcus considered blowing himself up along with Silco using Jinx's bomb but was ultimately unable to do so. [8] 
 When  Jayce Talis , very recently appointed a Councilor, ordered him to tighten security at the Hexgates, Marcus tried to warn him and advised him to consult the Council first. True enough, Jayce would later need to take this back when he learned from  Mel  that the decision was poorly received. Jayce was unhappy about this, though, and in frustration and hopes of getting ahead of further attacks from—as Marcus relayed—the Firelights, Jayce took his joking suggestion to form a blockade at the bridge and search everyone who would attempt to pass seriously. [5] 
 When  Caitlyn  tried to cross the bridge back to  Piltover , now with evidence against Silco, Marcus threatened to shoot her. He hesitated and was ultimately not given the chance to decide whether he would go through with it or not as  Jinx 's weaponized  firelight bombs  surrounded them and went off. Marcus survived long enough to try and pass on a message to his daughter through Caitlyn but succumbed to his injuries before he could finish his sentence. [9] 
 With this, the Council was finally made aware of his partnership with Silco, though Caitlyn tried to somewhat save his reputation by clarifying that he did it not primarily for what he would gain but for  what  he had to lose. [10] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Marcus is shown to be aggressive towards Zaunites and arrogant towards his peers, especially after his elevation to Sheriff. He often dismisses the concerns of his inferiors, i.e., Caitlyn, and does not hesitate to assert his authority when needed. An example of this is assigning the graveyard shift at the Progress Day festival to Caitlyn when she disobeyed his orders. 
 Although he is depicted as unfeeling and apathetic to people's suffering, he is shown to have a soft spot for his daughter whenever her safety is concerned. Silco uses this weakness to manipulate him by threatening to harm her if Marcus doesn't comply with his orders. Even though he is corrupt, occasionally, he is shown ruminating and regretting his harmful actions—but he never takes action to repent for them.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Marcus is a slim, tall man, perhaps in his mid-thirties or early forties. He is pale-skinned, with short, small, dark brown hair with graying sideburns and a Brett's beard. He has small brown eyes with bags under them and thick eyebrows. He has a big, thick nose and a mustache under it. He is often seen wearing his Enforcer uniform, even at home.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Accuracy : As an Enforcer and Sheriff, it can be assumed that Marcus was a good shooter.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 Mel was the product of an affair her  mother  had with a mage on her  husband . Ambessa raised Mel to use aggression and violence in her political life, but Mel had looked up to her brother  Kino 's way of peace and negotiation in politics. 
 Mel was given the chance to choose how Ambessa dealt with a foreign princess, and Mel had suggested to banish her and take all of her possessions. Unhappy with this choice, Ambessa had the foreign princess killed instead.
 Later, Mel was banished by Ambessa to Piltover as her daughter weakened her emotionally. Mel would go on to become the richest person in Piltover, along with joining the Council.
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 In her chambers,  Elora  tells Mel that she's now the richest person in  Piltover  and yet she sighs, saying she's the poorest in Medarda. She notes her desire for something fresh and innovative and hears from Elora about the upcoming trial of  Jayce Talis  and his background. [1] 
 Afterward, Mel gives a present to fellow  Piltover Council  member  Torman Hoskel , who loves it. Sometime after Jayce’s trial, she listens to a report from  Grayson  and  Marcus  about the culprits still at large who stole from Jayce's workshop. [1] 
 One night, Mel catches Jayce and  Viktor  attempting to break into  Heimerdinger's  lab. The two would be trespassers who try to reason with Mel in their endeavor. Perhaps on a whim, Mel gives them one day to prove they're right and, in the process, averts the attention of the local patroler  Harold . [2] 
 Eventually, Heimerdinger, accompanied by two guards, confronts Viktor and Jayce, who successfully complete their experiment. Although Heimerdinger reprimands the two for their actions, Mel defends them, saying that it's the era of magic, but Jayce corrects her, stating it's the era of Hextech. [2] 
 Mel attends a party fundraiser with her fellow Council members and socialites; she's soon joined by her assistant, Elora. They chat for a bit, and Mel confesses that no one there interests him, but alludes to Jayce as the only one she'd be interested in talking to. The ma question arrives, approaches Mel, and asks her to speak privately with him. [3] 
 The two head into Mel's office, where Jayce claims that Heimerdinger wants more time to develop his newest project. Mel argues that it's ""Progress Day,"" a day when people from around the world gather to see what new developments the City of Progress has to offer. She continues stating that if there's a time to showcase a new project, it is now. Jayce sighed at what Mel said, and she stated that Heimerdinger was too focused on the past and that the city needed someone who looked forward to the future. In Mel's opinion, that someone was Jayce, who questioned that, but Mel claims that Hextech has changed everything, and the world is ready to release it. She also mentions that she's spoken to several investors. Mel ends it by stating that it'll be his speech and that Jayce should give the people a glimpse into the future. [3] 
 However, Mel was notably displeased when Jayce refused to show off his new invention during his speech and left with Elora after he was done. [3] 
 The day after the Progress Day celebration,  Jinx  stole the Hextech Crystal ball, which was the subject of a Council Meeting. For the most part, Mel tacitly observes the meeting as her Council opines their thoughts and concerns until Jayce proposes a complete shutdown of all Hextech studies until the matter is resolved. Mel proposes a compromise because Torman and Shoola disagree with Jayce's proposal; she suggests that Jayce become a councilor and his House be elevated. Shoola states her opinion on how unorthodox Mel's proposal is. Still, Heimerdinger seconds the notion, and Mel suggests a vote to be held. [3] 
 During a musical performance at a theater, Mel warns Jayce that his house is in trouble due to his desire to purge the corruption in the city. It has put a target on his back, one that she warns even those with whom he shares a seat on the council have their disdain for his actions. Despite Jayce's loathing being roped into a political game by Mel, she coaxes him to continue as it'd benefit him and his interests. [4] 
 They're then joined by the merchant  Amara , who details that Enforcers visited her that morning and searched her place. Mel apologizes for that and notes that Jayce had to show safety and wanted to renegotiate old deals with whoever shared his vision. Amara claims that  Bolbok  had a counteroffer, but Mel refutes it, claiming he's stuck in the past while they are onward to the future. Jayce chimes in and speaks in favor of the deal, which Amara accepts, and Mel smiles as they shake on it. [4] 
 Afterward, Mel congratulates Jayce for the successful deals he made with his fellow council members, and the two romantically bond with each other, until Jayce learns that Viktor had a medical emergency. [4] 
 Mel works away at a painting when she's soon joined by Jayce, who apologizes for abruptly leaving her the night before and confesses that his work partner Viktor was dying. As Jayce explains the situation surrounding Viktor, she asks him why she was telling her all of that, and he claims it's because he feels confident whenever he's around her. This prompts Mel to suggest that he return to Viktor. [5] 
 Eventually, a meeting is held concerning Piltover's fractured nature, and despite Heimerdinger's desire to reevaluate and change the Council's immoral ways, Jayce argues differently. He claims that Heimerdinger is a relic of the past. Despite being the founder of Piltover, Heimerdinger was unanimously voted out, with Mel casting the first vote with an apology on her behalf. [5] 
 A young Mel stands before a ruined throne in a dilapidated room. Her mother  Ambessa  enters the room tells her about a lesson her grandfather imposed on her and the importance of learning about death. [6] 
 At that moment, two soldiers enter the room with a female prisoner, Ambessa asks Mel what they should do with her, and Mel suggests exile. However, Ambessa notes that she must die as it'd cause trouble down the line if she caused an uprising and were executed on the spot. [6] 
 The entire scenario was a dream that Mel painted a mural of behind her bed featuring the blood-stained remains of the prisoner. Looking beside her, Mel sees Jayce sleeping awkwardly beside her. [6] 
 Afterward, Mel and Jayce investigate the Bridge to Progress, where the bodies of the deceased Enforcers were there, including Marcus. Seeing it all causes Jayce to vomit off the bridge side, and Mel stands in shock. [6] 
 Eventually, Mel greets her mother as she exits her ship. The two share an exchange where Mel is notably displeased with her mother's presence, but Ambessa is coy to play innocent. As they walk forward, Ambessa reveals that Kino has passed away after crossing the ""wrong man,"" and Ambessa blames herself for his loss. [6] 
 Ambessa segues the conversation to Jayce and his hextech weaponry, which Mel scorns and tries to walk away from. However, Ambessa argues that war is on the horizon. Mel refutes that Piltover is like Nexus and claims that war isn't their first and only resource. Although Ambessa disagrees, she then leaves when a handsome escort arrives to transport her out of there. [6] 
 During a council meeting about the bombing on the bridge, Mel sits and watches as the council members contemplate what could have triggered it and Marcus' betrayal. They're soon joined by  Caitlyn  and  Vi , who explains the reason for Marcus' betrayal. They blame Silco for the recent events, and despite Jayce wanting to invade  Zaun , she proposes they act diplomatically, which Vi finds outrageous and leaves. [6] 
 Mel confronts her mother over manipulating Jayce into invading Zaun and wants her to leave Piltover. Ambessa claims it was to accelerate the hextech research process and to protect them from the man who killed Kino, who far exceeds them in power. This leads to Ambessa revealing that Mel was expelled from the family because she was a liability to Ambessa, but she promises that when they get the hextech, she can return home to her side. [7] 
 Mel attends a council meeting with her fellow council meetings and Viktor, where it's announced that Zaun seeks independence, causing an outcry of disapproval. However, Mel votes in favor of it, and a rocket strikes the area after the entire council has done so. [7] 
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Huddled with Jayce, who asks if she's alright as smoke and cinders fill the area of the destroyed Council room, Mel is helped up by him. They're shocked to see the corpses of Iris and Torman's corpses lying on the ground under or on rubble. [8] 
 As Jayce finds the dead body of Cassandra, Mel is approached by her mother, Ambessa, who asks if she's alright. Mel confirms she is, and her mother then orders her soldiers to assist the Enforcers in the area to help. [8] 
 Eventually, consoles  Caitlyn  over the loss of her mother  Cassandra , and they're soon joined by a wheelchair-bound Salo, who Ambessa was wheeling in. With new thoughts on Zaun, Salo suggests purging the place of its ""demons"", but Mel thanks Ambessa for wheeling Salo in. [8] 
 Mel then heads a debate on how to handle the situation with Zaun; as Salo argues under the influence of Ambessa to attack Zaun, Mel believes acting with impetus could immensely backfire. In her opinion, Mel believes that a sizable bounty should be placed on Jinx's head, but  Shoola  isn't keen on the idea. Salo then declares that Mel was outvoted two to one, but Mel regains the upper hand after agreeing to the invasion but rules against the use of Hextech. [8] 
 Afterward, Mel meets with a morose Jayce, who informs her of the comatose Viktor's condition inside the Hexcore. Trying to touch the Hexcore substance that Viktor was enveloped in, it nearly harms her, and Mel curiously asks what it's doing to him. Jayce answers that the Hexcore is evolving faster than what he can come up with. To his confession, Jayce laments that Viktor is in the state he's in and not himself. Mel consoles the agitated and remorseful Jayce and then details how the council meeting went, including how her mother's influential manipulation has hooked Salo on her goals. She assures Jayce that all will be well and suggests he meet with Caitlyn. [8] 
 By dusk, Mel gives a speech to the people of  Piltover  centered around the loss of the three recently deceased council members and the plans for retaliations for those responsible. However, her speech is interrupted by a hoodlum disguised as an Enforcer and  Renni  who is in the audience and tries to kill Jayce. As enemy reinforcements arrive, Mel is escorted to safety by the Enforcer  Steb . [8] 
 Later, Mel attends a private meeting with her fellow council members, who discuss how Renni and her cohorts managed to attack the place. They're soon joined by Caitlyn, who announces an endeavor to launch a counterstrike against Zaun. [8] 
 Mel is mentioned a couple of times by her mother in different conversations. She also gets an update from her spy  Lest , who informs her of Ambessa's plans and something to ""take out"", Salo. [9] 
 Afterward, Elora confirms to Mel that Lest's information is accurate and chastises herself for overlooking things. However, Mel asks Elora if she's looked into the other matter concerning her brother and those responsible for his death. She then hands Elora the vial given to her by Lest and asks her to have the apothecary look over it and check in on Amara. [9] 
 She is later seen in shock as colorful smog spreads across Piltover. [9] 
 Sometime later, Elora and Mel are captured by some from the  Black Rose . [9] 
 Mel is mentioned in a conversation between Lest and Salo about her disappearance. [10] 
 Awakening at an undisclosed location, Mel recalls when the Black Rose group captured her and Elora. Passing out for a while, Mel awakens to the voice of her brother  Kino , who reveals that they're sealed in an Oculorum. After speaking of an old family joke, Mel asks Kino to enter the light, revealing his identity to her. The two then lovingly embrace. [11] 
 As Mel continues chatting with Kino, she presses against one of the stones in the wall, causing it to shift, move, and extend one of the rocks on the wall. Kino then reveals that why they're there is because Ambessa had an affair once with someone that led to the birth of a bastard child, one of whom their captors fear. [11] 
 Resolute to solve the puzzle of the Oculorum, Kino advises against it as his voice starts to become distorted. Mel then grabs Kino's face and slams it against the wall as his appearance shifts from Kino to Elora to herself. With a smile, the fake Mel engulfs Mel with its thorns and entraps her in chained thorns, only for her to release herself by awakening a hidden power from within her. [11] 
 Awakening to her Mage powers, Mel, now covered in golden tattoos, finds herself in the same dilapidated throneroom where her mother once executed a prisoner. The  Illusionary Sorceress  appears before Mel, and as they talk, she takes on many forms and reveals that she killed her brother because of her mother's pride. Realizing that the Illusionary Sorceress wants to recruit her, Mel asks what her mother did to earn her scorn. The Illusionary Sorceress warns of an impending war caused by her mother, and she is the key to preventing it. She then offers Mel a necklace as a token of acceptance of her offer, and Mel accepts it. [12] 
 At the restored council room, Mel meets with Jayce; they argue for a bit until Viktor arrives, manipulating a mechanical construct. A temperamental Jayce tries to attack it, leading to a fight between them, and Mel and Jayce manage to defeat Viktor. [12] 
 The two later have a heart-to-heart about their shortcomings and realizations. [12] 
 Eventually, Mel visits her mother at her camp and confronts her about the Black Rose and her brother's death. She also demands that Piltover be left out of her feud and return home, which she'd accompany, but Ambessa refuses because of her Noxian pride. Ambessa then shows her an ""army that does not fear death"", and Mel is left astonished by what she has witnessed. [12] 
 Mel meets with Jayce, Caitlyn, and Vi about Jayce's plans to stop Viktor's invasion. On the day of the invasion, Mel stands beside Shoola as Noxus invaders are kept at bay by the Enforcers. [13] 
 Afterward, Mel appears before her mother; she pleads with her mother to reconsider, but she refuses. After Viktor's orb is destroyed and found to be empty, Mel chastises her mother for her actions and assists Caitlyn in her duel against her mother. She'd then use the necklace that the Illusionary Sorceress gave her, which summons the sorceress and makes her entrap Ambessa in her realm. However, Mel enters it, frees her mother from the realm, and then listens to Ambessa's final words as she dies in her arms. [13] 
 Eventually, she's possessed by one of Viktor's dolls, but later released by their control. [13] 
 Sometime after the war, Mel becomes the new Queen of Noxus. [13] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Mel presents herself as a methodical and sometimes cold-hearted woman who acts in her interests. She detests violence and war, seeing diplomacy as a better option, which leads to her banishing from her family's clan.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Mel is a dark-skinned woman with greenish-gold eyes and black curly hair in twists with golden cuffs at her hairline. She is renowned for her striking, stylish appearance, which usually includes tasteful, clean makeup, a strong lip, and a piercing cat eye. The design mainly consists of a white color palette with gold accents. 
 In one scene, she is in a skintight gold and white ensemble replete with ornate gold jewelry. Her get-up includes a lacy black see-through undershirt, a dual-strapped black choker, open white flower-petal sleeves, and a flowing white dress to match. She also has rutilant golden shoulder pads and dangling gold earrings. 
 In season 2, after being kidnapped by the Black Rose, she loses her gold hair cuffs and grows disheveled. Her makeup wears off, and her outfit grows dirty.
 When she awakens as a mage, she wears a black one-piece with smaller textured designs over the fabric. Her golden markings spread all over her body, including her face.
 Her body turns a purplish shade when using her full power, and her golden accents shine. Her eyes turn white, as does her hair.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 After Mel shattered the thorn domain with her newfound power, the mysterious member confirmed that Mel Medarda is a  mage/sorceress  similar to her. Moreover, she belongs to a rare category of mage as they described her as an  empath . According to them,  Mel is like a conduit and a mirror simultaneously as she has the power to sense other people’s inner selves and bend their magic. 
 Since she is a sorceress, Mel’s eyes turn golden, and the tattoos that run all over her body shine bright when she uses her powers. Hence the term “sorceress”. She has the following powers:
 Shield:  In several instances, Mel puts forth a magical shield that protects herself and deflects hazardous attacks
 Celestial Beam:  Mel was seen channelizing her arcane to unleash a powerful golden-colored beam that obliterates opponents.
 Ultimate Magic:  When she was captured inside the domain full of thorns, Mel unleashed her full power by letting loose her golden arcane magic like an electrifying shock power.

 History [ ] 
 With Vi and Claggor, Mylo sometimes went on jobs for Vander since the children were eager to prove themselves and be treated like adults. Mylo often made the younger orphan Powder the target of his irritation, often calling her a jinx for foiling their jobs.
 During one particular trip to  Piltover  to rob a  workshop  on  Ekko 's tip, Powder accidentally caused an explosion that caught the attention of the  enforcers , thus initiating a manhunt for the culprits. With their descriptions closely matching their ragtag group, Vander asked them to lay low, [1]  but still found themselves almost getting caught several times. Vi tried to surrender herself in their stead, [2]  only to be stopped by Vander, who was taken by  Silco  before he could be taken back to the upper city. When Vi told them, Mylo and Claggor insisted on coming with.
 Once at Silco's  Shimmer  factory, Mylo picked the locks on Vander's bindings while Vi faced off against Silco's goons and Claggor made an escape route for them. Before they can escape, however, Powder causes an explosion with the stolen  magic crystals , killing him and Claggor in the ensuing collapse. [3] 
 
 
 
 Mylo and Claggor's deaths continued to haunt Powder for years to come. Powder, who'd started going by Jinx, created dummies that somewhat resembled them. Jinx also manifested them as invisible companions or voices that would often influence her decisions. [4] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Mylo is very confident in himself. This results in him bragging a lot, which  Vi  tells him off about. He also has the tendency to complain or pick fights with the rest of the group. [1] 
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Mylo is a lanky teen of average height for his age with thick scruffy eyebrows, a deep widow's peak, and sloped face, giving him a crow-like appearance. He wears a white sleeveless shirt, leather shoulder pads, baggy pants that cinch above the ankle, and he has bands of twine around his arm.

 Vi ’s death [ ] 
 When Vi dies, this is where the two universes diverge. Mylo can be seen on the ground, eyes filled with tears as he begins to panic at the sight of his dead sister.
 
 Ekko ’s arrival [ ] 
 When Ekko enters  The Last Drop  with  Powder , Mylo and  Claggor  walk up to them and talk. They sit down, but he notices  Gert  working and decides to walk up to her. Claggor tells Powder to go “save him”, as Mylo stutters when trying to catch Gert’s attention. Powder helps him; asking about her next performance (which happened to be the night of the Innovator’s Competition). 
 At said competition, he and Claggor both watch Gert’s performance.
 
 Characteristics [ ]

 This Mylo is identically personality wise to the main universe; he is very confident and cracks jokes often. He tends to overstep his confidence, though, as seen when he tries to talk to Gert.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Mylo has a few new additions to his design that includes new facial hair (mustache and sideburns) and a completely new outfit. He wears a green jacket with a large white collar, brown and green vest decorated with golden accents, and a red cloth tied around his neck.

 The  City of Piltover Police Department  is the law enforcement agency in  Piltover .
 The Department presumably has a number of departments and ranks under it. Their duties range from investigating and arresting criminals (under the Piltover Enforcer Department), [1]  patrolling  Zaun  and Piltover's streets, as well as the Academy and Council building, [2]  watching over events in the city and their high-ranking officials, [3]  serving as prisonguards of  Stillwater Hold  (under the Piltover Department of Corrections), [4]  guarding the ports and inspecting shipments, [3] [5]  enforcing orders and laws as imposed by  Councilors , [6] [7]  among many others.

 Relations with Zaun [ ] 
 Though enforcers are meant to be protectors of both Piltover and Zaun, there is some level of animosity between enforcers and Zaunites — Zaunites tend to fear enforcers as the latter are often inclined to be violent and unfair in treatment towards them, while enforcers have some level of fear about stepping into the undercity.
 For decades, however, in efforts to maintain a semblance of peace, Sheriff  Grayson  made a deal with  Vander  where she would ensure that the enforcers would not meddle too much in Zaun business if Vander kept the Zaunites in check and kept Zaunite chaos out of Piltover's streets. Upon their deaths, this deal was replaced with the later new Sheriff  Marcus ' deal with  Silco , though this new deal was corrupt and for the benefit of both parties instead of the citizens' benefit.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 Powder was born to Felicia and Connol, the younger sister of  Violet , better known as Vi. Growing up, Powder had a good relationship with her sister and her parents. However, when her parents died during a battle on the bridge between Piltover and Zaun, she and Vi were the only people left in their family. After the battle,  Vander  found the two siblings; he adopted them and raised them as his own, alongside  Mylo  and  Claggor .
 At some point in her childhood, Powder became friends with  Ekko .
 
 Vi’s death [ ] 
 In this reality, Vi died in Powder's arms during the break-in at  Jayce’s  lab, from a  Hextech crystal  explosion. This event appears to be where the timelines branched. 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Powder is lively and bubbly, showing great care for her family. She’s taken the role of the caretaker of her siblings and developed a romantic relationship with Ekko. Vander has a talk with her (apparently one of many) where he tells her she’s “too smart” to spend all her time in a bar and insinuates that her family is holding her back. Powder counters, saying she is happy where she is. She shows the same talent of being an inventor as she did as a child, and seems gentle and caring. She mourns her sister and has a small memorial in her laboratory, including a small doll that looks like Vi. She handles the grief well despite her pain, and talks to her sister often.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Powder has fair skin, blue eyes, and blue hair with a pink streak on the left side, seemingly in honor of her sister, Vi. She has thick bangs and typically wears her hair up in two small space buns. When down, her hair reaches her shoulders. Her makeup is natural and light. She typically paints her nails light blue but alternates to all purple at the party. She wears a choker necklace as well as Vi’s necklace. She still has a blue cloud tattoo on the right side of her abdomen, although it is hidden.
 At the party, She wears vibrant blue and pink eye makeup along with a jacket and dress with two piercings in her left ear. 
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Trivia [ ] 
 Unlike Jinx, Powder shows no sign of severe mental illness. 
 Powder's secret laboratory is the same location as Jinx’s hideout. 
 
 Powder secretly kept a stash of unrefined  Hextech crystals  in Vi’s shrine. [1]

 History [ ] 
 Along with the other most notorious crime lords of Zaun, Renni became part of the group of  chem-barons  that secretly controlled the undercity, led by  Silco .
 At one point, Renni came to require a  green substance  to constantly be delivered through her nose, for which she wore a suit that holds the conduits for the substance. [1] 
 Renni's side of their businesses involved abducting Zaunite children to experiment on. When an  enforcer  happened upon one of their laboratories, the enforcers were able to interrogate one of their victims and was able to at least identify the person running things as a woman who wore a suit. At least one found evidence at the scene—an experimental  suit —had her name on it as the intended user.  Marcus , due to the then Captain of the enforcers' partnership with Silco, was able to halt the release of information and further investigation on her illicit activities. Another enforcer,  Caitlyn Kiramman , found the records of this and kept it as part of an ongoing investigation on  the underground's then unknown ruler  and his  mole  in Piltover. [2] 
 After the actions of Silco's adoptive daughter  Jinx  caused the closure of the borders to Piltover, Renni and the other chem-barons' businesses were affected. They called a meeting to discuss their next action, during which  Finn  tried to convince them to stand their ground against Silco and his unwillingness to stop Jinx's antics. Before they could discuss further, Silco arrived and unleashed a toxic gas in the air before giving them gas masks, reminding them of the insufferable past he'd saved them from. [1] 
 During an unexpected raid on one of their  Shimmer  factories, Renni's son, who was working at the factory and had been the one to sound the building's alarms, was accidentally killed by  Jayce Talis . [3]  When Renni arrived, she demanded justice from Silco; when the latter told her that her son died fighting for the cause, she called him out for the hypocrisy, being unwilling to similarly sacrifice his own  daughter .
 Following this incident, Renni fully allied with Finn and his plans of overthrowing Silco for control over the undercity once and for all. He joined Finn in confronting him, accompanied by  Sevika  whom they believed had been turned, only for the latter to kill Finn. Silco told her that if her son hadn't already been killed, he would have ordered it now for her betrayal. Silco then allowed her to leave. [4] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Renni is a tall pale skinned woman with a metal nose and wrinkly skin. She has red hair with shaved sides and no eyebrows, along with dark eye-shadow, lipstick, and lashes.

 Biography [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Rictus travels alongside Ambessa to  Piltover . He remains her personal guard throughout all her appearances in Act 3.
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Rictus is in the  battle at the Councilor's Memorial , and slays multiple  Chemtanks . It’s shown later in the season that he gave  Renni  compensation for  her son ’s death.  
 In  Episode 3 , when  Amara  uses her powers to try and kill Ambessa, Rictus is also held down by the magic. He then breaks free from her powers using his raw strength and the runes strapped to his weapon. When Ambessa kills her, he tells Ambessa that Amara’s death will not go unnoticed for long.
 After the time skip between Act 1 and Act 2, Rictus and Ambessa try utilizing  Hextech Gemstones , though they fail each time. He assumes it’s the work of the  Black Rose . Later,  Rictus is seen working at a border checkpoint  somewhere in  Zaun . He grabs a man in line, who he reveals to be a  Jinxer . He takes the man with him to ""interrogate"", by which he beats him up to the point of confession. The Jinxer tells him that the revolutionaries are meeting at the Vander Statue, and Rictus appears at their meeting in which he takes (mostly) all of them to  Stillwater Hold . This includes  Isha ,  Singed , and  Gert , among others. 
 In  Episode 6 , Rictus guards Ambessa and  Caitlyn Kiramman  while they spar in the training room. He is chanting something while hovering a hand over the runes wrapped (now unwrapped) on his weapon in a small bowl of burning charcoal. He joins Ambessa and the other  Noxian Soldiers  as they march to Viktor's Commune. When  Vi  and Caitlyn start their plan to attack Ambessa, Ambessa dismisses him. When Caitlyn knocks  Singed  unconscious in the greenhouse inside the commune, Rictus appears behind her, infuriated that she betrayed Ambessa. The two begin to fight and he easily overpowers the other until  Jinx  comes in. While she gets a few blows in, he uses the runes on his weapon to evade the shots from her handgun.  Vander  wakes up, though, and throws him out of the greenhouse. After  Viktor  is killed by  Jayce Talis , Vander gets enraged, and viciously mauls Rictus to death.
 Ambessa holds a traditional Noxian funeral for him in  Episode 8  where his body is buried with his weapon on top of the grave.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 He is quite stoic, always appearing as really calm and in control, even in situation of stress. He is infinitely loyal to Ambessa and doesn’t hesitate to torture, kill and incapacitate for their cause. 
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Rictus is big, towering even over Ambessa who already dwarfs most people. He has mohawk style hairs and a quite substantial brown mustache and beard. He wears other decorum on his face, like a tattoo between his eyes, a stub above his right eye and under his mouth, and black eyeliner under his eyes. 
 He wears the common Noxian Soldier garb and armor, without the helmet, just upsized for his own stature.
 
 Powers and Abilities [ ] 
 Strength:  He was able to counteract a spell place upon him with raw might alone, long enough for him to negate it with his weapon. He is capable of easily strangling Caitlyn, a trained enforcer and can easily lift people off the ground with one hand. More impressively, he can easily body slam and overpower Jinx, someone who always benefits from the effects of Shimmer due to it flowing in her veins. 
 Speed:  He was able to react to Jinx’s pistol while it was travelling towards him, moving fast enough to block it with his weapon. He was then able to somewhat match Jinx in speed, someone who heavily relies on speed in close combat. 
 Martial Combat:  He can easily take down those who stand in his way with his bare hands alone. On top of that, he is potent with his polearm weapon, being able to use different defensive moves in reaction to opposing attacks, even fighting a close quarter fight with a heavy polearm weapon, attesting to his skill at-arm. 
 Endurance:  He took a direct off-guard hit from Warwick and was still conscious enough afterward to reach for his weapon. 
 
 Weapons 
 
 Glaive : The polearm weapon he seemingly wears as hi primary one. The pole is outfitted with multiple runic talisman’s. These talisman are able to negate magic like the Thorn Magic, and even Hextech is no match for it’s defensive capability. 
 Armor : His armour looks heavier and more sturdy than those of the enforcers.

 Rio is a pivotal yet enigmatic creature featured in  Arcane , whose biological properties are central to the creation of Shimmer.

 Appearance and Abilities [ ] 
 Rio is a unique, rare creature that possesses remarkable regenerative abilities. In  Arcane , it is shown as a large, mutated animal, heavily resembling an Axolotl, with incredible healing powers. Rio's regenerative capabilities are vital to  Singed ’s research. The creature can rapidly heal wounds and recover from injuries that would typically be fatal to other beings. Singed's experiments aim to extract and harness this regenerative property, with the ultimate goal of using it to create Shimmer—a drug that could grant enhanced strength, speed, and resilience to its users.
 
 Role in Shimmer’s Creation [ ] 
 Singed’s use of Rio is crucial in the development of  Shimmer . The creature's regenerative essence provides the foundational biological material needed to create the drug. Singed essentially exploits Rio’s extraordinary ability to heal itself to unlock the secrets of human enhancement. This exploitation is central to Singed’s worldview: to achieve his scientific breakthroughs, he is willing to sacrifice innocent life, treating Rio as just another tool in his ruthless pursuit of progress.
 
 Moral Implications [ ] 
 Rio’s involvement in the creation of Shimmer highlights the ethical dilemma at the heart of Singed’s character. He treats the creature as an expendable resource, using its regenerative capabilities without regard for the suffering it endures. In the series, there’s a sense of tragedy surrounding Rio’s fate, as it becomes a test subject in Singed’s dark experiments. The creature's role symbolizes the cost of unchecked scientific ambition—the exploitation of life for the sake of discovery.
 
 Tragic Fate [ ] 
 Despite Rio’s unique regenerative powers, its eventual fate is tragic. Singed’s experiments push the creature beyond its limits, with the creature showing signs of pain and exhaustion as its body is continuously subjected to Singed’s harsh testing. While Rio’s role is critical in the creation of Shimmer, it also serves as a symbol of the broader theme in  Arcane —the sacrifice of the innocent in the name of power and progress.
 In conclusion,  Rio  is not just a biological subject in Singed’s experiments but also a tragic figure within the narrative of  Arcane . Its involvement in the creation of Shimmer reflects the moral corruption of Singed’s scientific pursuits and the costs associated with his relentless quest for knowledge.

 Biography [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Awaiting the trial for  Jayce Talis  in the  Piltover Council  chamber, Salo eats from a bag of nuts, overhearing the conversations that occur there. Overhearing that it was  Torman Hoskel 's birthday, he hastily tried to give him the bag of nuts he was eating, but Torman lashed out at him because he had a nut allergy. [1] 
 During the trial, Salo disparages the academy for lowering its standards. When a vote is to be held for Jayce's sentencing to be expelled from the academy, Salo doesn't vote in favor of it. [1] 
 Salo is seen attending a party with his fellow Council members and socialites. [2] 
 The day after the Progress Day celebration,  Jinx  stole the Hextech Crystal ball, which was the subject of a Council Meeting. Ultimately, Mel suggests that Jayce become a councilor and his house be elevated too;  Heimerdinger  seconds it, and Mel proposes a vote be held. [2] 
 Salo is shown attending a theatrical performance with his fellow councilmen  Torman , who naturally hate each other. Still, their shared passion for spirits conjoins them. [3] 
 A meeting is held concerning Piltover's fractured nature, and despite Heimerdinger's desire to reevaluate and change the Council's immoral ways, Jayce argues differently. He claims that Heimerdinger is a relic of the past. Despite being the founder of Piltover, Heimerdinger was unanimously voted out. [4] 
 During a council meeting, Salo wonders why  Marcus  aligned himself with  Silco , wondering what they had to offer, but  Caitlyn  arrives with  Vi  stating it's what he had to lose. Jayce proposes they invade the lower city as the meeting continues, while Mel suggests diplomacy. To that point, Salo sides with Mel, and Vi's outburst causes him to demand the Enforcers to escort her out, but Vi leaves on her own volition. [5] 
 When Jayce brings up his deal with Silco to make  Zaun  a nation, he is initially angry. But, in the end, he votes for their freedom. Moments after this, a rocket fired by Jinx strikes the council room and kills some of the councilors. [6] 
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Due to Jinx's rocket, a large piece of rubble collapsed on Salo's lower body. Because of this, he becomes paralyzed. Later, in a meeting with the remaining councilors, he is pushed by  Ambessa  onto the floor. He believes that action should be taken against the undercity and  Hextech  should be used. Mel and Caitlyn immediately deny it, and with a vote from Mel and  Shoola , it does not happen. Later on, he is caught in a fight at the Councilor Memorial. When the councilors meet underneath the capital, he is aggravated at Caitlyn's appearance.   [7] 
 He grows addicted to  Shimmer  through an applicant brush he hires  Lest  to apply. Ambessa bursts in and kicks Lest out, and she begins to berate Salo for his recent decisions. She asks him to meet with all the important houses in the city, in which he happily obliges. When the meeting comes along, Ambessa speaks of a new general needed for the city. He thinks she's referring to him, until she nominated Cailtyn. [8] 
 After this, he is extremely depressed. He says how people look at him in pity, or turn their heads at the sight of him. Salo also begins craving more Shimmer when Lest tells him to go to a  healer  in the fissures.   [9] 
 Sometime between episode 4 and episode 5, he goes to Viktor and is healed by his touch. He regains his ability to walk as well.
 Salo visits the  Hexgates , and takes some of the components of the heart. Jayce materializes from the  wild rune , and begins to talk with Salo and Viktor. When Salo tries to leave, Jayce smashes him with his  hammer  and Salo dies.
 [10] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Salo is a posh and snappy man. He does not hide his opinions in council sessions or elsewhere. He is also bold in his approach to politics. 
 Later, when Viktor ""heals"" him from his Shimmer addiction, he becomes sympathetic and kind like all the other commune members.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Salo is a thin and angular man with green eyes and slicked back blonde hair. He has a sharp pointed nose. Salo's outfit consists of a white, red, and gold jacket with a high collar and shoulder pads. The jacket crisscrosses at his chest and wraps around his body to two tailcoats. He wears white pants that go all the way up to his chest, with four golden buttons at the top.
 Healed by Viktor, he wears white robes with a large hood and belts crosses on his body. He has the signature purple iridescent fingerprints from being healed by the herald and new blueish eyes. His legs are covered with the shiny metal formed when something ""broken"" is healed by Viktor. 
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Hivemind Communication : When healed, Viktor can take over Salo's body to communicate.

 Biography [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Sitting at a table in the bar of  The Last Drop , Sevika proposes that Zaun strike back at the people of  Piltover , and everyone else in the bar yells in agreement. However,  Vander  voices in opposition, citing the dangers of what would happen if they retaliate. Disappointed in Vander's logic, she claims while Vander doesn't look afraid, he looks weak. She then takes her men out of the bar. [1] 
 Barrels of  Shimmer  are loaded onto an airship, and Sevika bribes the worker there to allow it onboard, claiming it was from a friend downtown. Moments after this, a group known as the  Firelights  arrive and incapacitate everyone by using crystallization bombs. [2] 
 Eventually, Jinx reveals herself and kills a few members of the Firelights,  one of whom  resembled  Vi , causing her to go berserk. Once all of the remaining Firelights have fled the ship as the Shimmer on board had been ignited by a flare, Sevika frees herself from the crystallization and reprimands Jinx. [2] 
 Afterward, Sevika returns to The Last Drop, where she reports to Silco about Jinx's mishap on the airship. Silco sees no harm in it, as some Firelights were disposed of. Still, Sevika thinks that Jinx is a liability and believes that everyone agrees, but Silco questions that last comment and notes that he doesn't want Sevika to fail him again. With a grunt, Sevika leaves Silco's office. 
 [2] 
 Playing a game of cards with two men, Sevika is ambushed by the sudden appearance of  Vi , who knees her to the ground. The two brawl until  Caitlyn  appears from a high walkway and fires a rifle at her, causing her to flee the scene. She'd later report this incident to Silco, who was left astonished that Vi was alive. [3] 
 The bartender of The Last Drop,  Thieram , mentions Sevika's name when explaining the local news to Jinx. [4] 
 Sevika returns to Silco's office to report that Vi has yet to be captured and finds Jinx sitting in his chair. She tries to attack her, but trips a gas trap, causing her to fall unconscious. Upon awakening, Sevika is tied to Silco's chair and is interrogated by Jinx about how Vi was found with an  Enforcer . Despite Jinx not wanting to believe it, Sevika insists it's true and claims that Jinx's rebellion will prove to Silco that Jinx is too dangerous for their cause. Unfazed by Sevika's accusation, Jinx makes the ""message"" absolutely clear. [4] 
 Sevika is also mentioned a couple of times, once when she mistakes Vi for Jinx. The other time was when Jinx was reunited with Vi and saw that Caitlyn the Enforcer was there too, just like Sevika said. [4] 
 Returning to his office after his encounter with Vi and Caitlyn, Silco finds the unconscious Sevika roped to his ceiling. [4] 
 In Silco's office, Sevika informs Silco about the Enforcers closing off the bridge, her thoughts on Marcus, and that Silco should wait for Jinx to come to him. [5] 
 Afterward, Sevika accompanies  Silco  to a council meeting with the  Chem-Barons . She unleashes gas from the Lanes into the meeting room from a tank. This causes the Chem-Barons to cough and wheeze until Silco passes around masks for them. [5] 
 At the Last Drop, Sevika performs a tune-up of her prosthetic arm while enjoying a cigar and a drink. She's soon joined by Chem-Baron  Finn , who proposes she turn against Silco because he favors Jinx more than he does her, despite the greater weight she pulls for him. However, Sevika denounces the cajolery as ego strokes. Hence, Finn gets straight to the point, claiming that Silco is slipping and that while the Lanes is in chaos, he believes that Silco isn't balancing everything. He states that the ego is one thing, while the brain is another and gets up from the table. Finn then offers Sevika a light from his lighter for her cigar and notes that she isn't the only one who is dissatisfied with Silco's performance. [6] 
 Sevika accompanies Silco in investigating the destroyed Silco manufacturing area, where she comments on how bold the upper city has become. She also listens to  Renni  mourn the loss of her son and pins the blame on Silco. Despite Renni's mourning, Silco asks Sevika to help with her son's body. She then looks at Finn, who is playing with his lighter. [7] 
 Afterward, she allows Finn and Renni to enter Silco's office, who believe that Silco has outlived his use since he had Vander taken out years ago. As Finn comments that today is the day Silco is going to die, Sevika reveals the hidden blade from her prosthetic arm, and instead of killing Silco, she kills Finn. Silco then tells the shocked Renni to leave, and then he asks if Sevika was tempted to betray him, but Sevika says not with someone like him. However, she warns him that Finn won't be the last one to oppose him. [7] 
 Eventually, Vi enters the Last Drop, where Sevika deals cards for some customers and demands they leave. Once they do, Sevika and Vi fight against each other, and ultimately, Sevika loses her prosthetic arm and is slammed against the jukebox. [7] 
 Sometime later, Sevika is seen sitting on the couch in Silco's office, struggling to light her cigar with her lighter. [7] 
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Sevika talks to the remaining  Chem-Barons , and tells them that in order to stand a chance against Piltover, they must team up.  Smeech  walks up to her, and tells her that all Piltover really wants is Jinx. If Sevika found Jinx, Smeech would make her a new mechanical arm.
 Later, in Silco's office, she struggles to fix her mechanical arm and starts complaining about his absence and how it had made everything worse. Jinx appears, and Sevika begins to get ready for a fight, until Jinx reveals shes not there for that. The two talk about Silco's absence, and Jinx leaves.
 When Jinx gets caught by Smeech and his goons, Sevika shows up to help. Jinx throws her her new mechanical arm and Sevika tries it out on Smeech, of which she kills with the help of the arm. Sevika and her talk further.
 Sevika teams up with Jinx in order to fight  Caitlyn Kiramman  and Vi, where she gets into a 1v1 with Caitlyn. Caitlyn began to overpower her, and when the Piltovan leaves, Sevika activates the bombs. She protects Jinx and  Isha  using her body.
 Months later, Sevika is mad that Jinx doesn't show up to any protests or riots. She asks her to join everyone and the Vander Statue, to which she refuses. 
 While at the meeting Sevika gives a speech to angry listeners. They don't want Sevika, they want Jinx. Isha appears, which begins to rally up the crowd. Sevika begins to raise her mechanical arm when  Rictus  and the  Noxian  soldiers appear and stab her arm in place. Sevika manages to escape and tell Jinx that Isha had been taken, and the two journey to  Stillwater Hold  to break the girl out, as well as all of the Zaunites who were captured.  
 While at the prison Jinx tries to distract an Enforcer, but Sevika quickly knocks the Piltovan unconscious. They sneak into the cart to the island disguised as an Enforcer and her prisoner. Once they get into the prison they knock the Enforcers out, and begin releasing the prisoners. Jinx is embraced as their hero while Sevika watches silently. 
 When  Vander  appears in the corridor, Jinx tells Sevika to take Isha and run. Sevika grabs the little girl and runs while Isha cries and tries to fight her way out of Sevika's grasp.
 Later, Sevika and  Scar  appear at the meeting between houses led by  Jayce Talis  for the start of a war against Noxus and  Viktor . She and Scar would later leave the meeting.
 Sevika appears in the final battle as the Zaunites join the battle. Afterwards, she is appointed as a member of the new Council.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Sevika is a bold, hard-working, and irritable person. She prefers fighting and confrontation compared to diplomacy and keeping the peace. [8]  She is not just a ruthless fighter but also a pragmatic leader with a deep, if conflicted, commitment to Zaun's cause. Her adaptability and resilience also deserve to be noticed.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Sevika is a bulky and muscular woman with tan skin. She has a round nose and sharp eyebrows. Her hair is black, and she has grey eyes.
 In Season One, her top hair is pulled back into a small ponytail with the bottom half hanging down. She wears a black and brown long-sleeved vest with gold adornments. Her main feature is her mechanical left arm, which consists of teal and bronze metal. It utilizes a  Shimmer  pump at the shoulder blade to enhance her strength.
 In Season Two, her new arm has a slot machine-like feature that decides what action it will pull (chomping, flamethrower, and more). The arm has a large claw at the end decorated with pink and blue doodles.
 Later in Season 2, she cuts her hair to a short middle cut.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Strength:  Sevika is strong, even more so when she’s using Shimmer to enhance herself. 
 Mechanical Arm:  By using her second mechanical arm, she can access multiple weapons. 
 Trivia [ ] 
 Sevika’s left arm was originally lost in  Powder’s   Hextech crystal  explosion, which also presumably killed  Vander . [9] 
 Sevika is (heavily) implied to be left-handed; She's seen struggling to use her right hand while attempting to repair her Robotic (left) arm in  Watch It All Burn . Later, Jinx taunts her by calling her ""Lefty"" after jokingly asking her if she can swim.

 Shimmer 
 
 
 

Shimmer was developed by  Singed , Zaun's infamous mad chemist, through a series of cruel and unethical experiments. His goal was to create a substance that could provide strength and power to  Zaun 's oppressed citizens, especially in the face of Piltover’s dominance. To achieve this, Singed drew upon various biological experiments, including the use of a unique creature named  Rio , a rare animal with regenerative properties. Singed attempted to harness Rio's biological essence to unlock the secrets of human enhancement, ultimately extracting its regenerative capabilities to create Shimmer. Through these experiments, Singed sought to find a way to permanently enhance the human body and mind, believing that such power could change the course of Zaun’s future.
 However, Shimmer’s creation was far from perfect. While the drug grants its users increased physical abilities and resilience, it comes with a steep price. Prolonged use leads to severe physical and mental deterioration, with users becoming addicted to its effects. Their bodies eventually break down, and their minds become unstable, leading to madness, violence, and death.
 
 Effects [ ] 
 The immediate effects of Shimmer are highly seductive—enhanced strength, speed, and endurance. Users become superhuman, capable of feats that would otherwise be impossible. However, this comes at the cost of their long-term health. Over time, Shimmer erodes the mind and body, leaving users physically deformed and mentally impaired. As the addiction worsens, users become more erratic and uncontrollable, leading to a vicious cycle of dependency.
 
 Connection to Silco [ ] 
 In  Arcane , Shimmer plays a central role in  Silco's  rise to power. He uses the drug to bolster his control over Zaun, distributing it to his followers and turning them into his loyal, enhanced enforcers. The drug is a means of maintaining power and loyalty, but it also becomes a symbol of the dangerous path Silco is willing to take in order to secure his vision for Zaun’s independence. Shimmer, as a tool of oppression, creates a cycle of addiction and violence that fuels the conflict in Zaun.
 
 Ethical Dilemmas and Consequences [ ] 
 Shimmer exemplifies the darker side of Zaun’s scientific and industrial exploitation. Singed’s creation of Shimmer, though rooted in his desire to transcend the limitations of human biology, highlights the moral decay that accompanies the pursuit of unchecked scientific progress. It serves as a metaphor for the dangerous consequences of playing with nature and human lives, a theme explored throughout  Arcane .
 In summary,  Shimmer  is a substance that symbolizes the corrupting influence of power, greed, and unchecked ambition. It offers temporary strength at a great cost, both to its users and the society that relies on it."

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 Nothing is known about Shoola’s early life, but it is assumed that she was appointed a Councilor before  Season 1 . 
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Shoola oversees  Jayce Talis '  trial  for possessing illegal equipment. Later, she, alongside her fellow Council members, listens to  Grayson  and  Marcus 's update on the thieves who  stole  from Jayce, which led to his trial. [1] 
 Shoola is later seen attending a party with her fellow Council members and socialites. [2] 
 The day after the  Progress Day  celebration,  Jinx  stole the  Hextech gemstone , which was the subject of a Council Meeting. To Shoola's confession, they've lost touch with the  Underground , but sympathize with their humanity. Once Jayce proposes that all  Hextech  operations be shut down, Shoola and  Torman  disapprove of this decision. However,  Mel  proposes that Jayce become a Councilor, and Shoola notes her concern about such a proposal.  Heimerdinger  seconds Mel's proposal, and Mel then proposes a vote be held. [3] 
 A  meeting  is held concerning  Piltover ’s fractured nature, and despite Heimerdinger's desire to reevaluate and change the Council's immoral ways, Jayce argues differently. He claims that Heimerdinger is a relic of the past. Despite being the founder of Piltover, Heimerdinger was unanimously voted out. [4] 
 Shoola attends a Council meeting about Marcus'  betrayal , and  Caitlyn  and  Vi  arrive to pin the blame on  Silco , who seeks to make Zaun independent. [5] 
 Shoola later attended another Council meeting with her fellow Councilors and  Viktor , where it was announced that Zaun was seeking independence, causing an outcry of disapproval. However, just as she votes in favor of it, a rocket launched by Jinx  hits the council room , nearly killing her. [6] 
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Shoola is shown to have survived the attack by Jinx but suffers an injury to the right side of her face, making her later wear a gold-plated mask. [7] 
 During the debate on how they should approach the issue with Zaun, she sides with  Salo  in invading Zaun, but sides with Mel in opposition to the use of Hextech. [7] 
 Eventually, Shaloo attends the speech by Mel, informing the people of Piltover of the recently deceased council members, where  Renni  and her cohorts launch an ambush attack on the area. They're soon joined by Caitlyn, who has plans for her own. [7] 
 Shoola and other nobles of Piltover attend a meeting where Jayce warns them all of an impending invasion by Viktor. [8] 
 As the war between  Noxus  and Piltover escalates, Shoola stands watch beside Mel giving orders to the Enforcers. [9] 
 Sometime after the invasion, Shoola stands beside  Sevika  performing a sending-off ceremony and is later seen sitting close to Sevika, a new council member. [9] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Shoola acts calm and mindful. She also always speaks softly and gracefully.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Shoola is a dark-skinned woman who always wears golden earrings, makeup, long, pointed jewelry on each of her fingers, and a massive golden necklace that turns on itself with a mechanism.

 Biography [ ] 
 History [ ] 
 In their youth, Vander and Silco formed a strong, brotherly bond over their shared dreams for  Zaun 's freedom and unity as one nation. At one point, however, the two had a falling out, after which Vander tried to drown Silco in a river. Due to an open gash on his left eye and the pollution in the river, this eye was contaminated and permanently disfigured. By briefly faking his death, Silco swiped Vander's dagger, stabbed him in the arm, and fled.
 Silco went into hiding, amassing followers and avoiding crossing paths with Vander for years to come. Despite their last encounter, Silco still respected Vander for their time together until he found out about Vander's deal with  Enforcers  that kept Zaun in check but in relative peace from upper city interference, a decision Silco strongly resented. [2] 
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 At one point, Silco had a group of Zaunites led by  Deckard  tail Vander's adoptive children. He'd given the boy instructions not to interfere, which the boy defied by brawling with them and trying to steal their loot, gaining the attention of Vander and  Benzo . Though frustrated, he was appeased when Deckard told him that the children were responsible for the explosion in Piltover earlier that day. After dismissing the boy,  Singed  showed Silco his latest, fairly effective batch of  Shimmer . [3] 
 Seeing an opportunity in the trouble the children caused, Silco decided to move up the timeline of his plans. Frustrated at the boy, Silco decided to make Deckard the first human to test Shimmer, though Silco could easily convince him. He also contacted  Marcus , one of the Enforcers investigating the children's case, and made a deal with him. [4]  Silco didn't tell him the whole picture, however, and surprised the Enforcer when he had the  Sheriff  killed, telling him about the change of his terms only after the fact and right as he handed him his money. Silco then took Vander from Marcus’ custody and took him to his Shimmer factory. [2] 
 [5] 
 [6] 
 [7] 
 [8] 
 [9] 
 Silco went to a statue of Vander, pondering his current situation where he'd found himself in the same position that Vander himself had been in—stuck with a choice between a chance at Zaun's independence and his daughter's safety. Vander's decision had been one Silco held against him for years. Still, one Silco found himself about to make, telling Vander's image that he understood now. Jinx was listening in, unbeknownst to him, and mistakenly assumed that Silco would give her up to the upper city. With this, Jinx knocked him out and took him to the place where it all started: Silco's old Shimmer factory at the cannery. She tied him to a dining chair and later returned with  Vi . [10] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Silco is a thin pale-skinned man with black graying hair. He has defined cheekbones, an eagle nose, and thin lips with a large chemical burn scar on his left eye. He sometimes wears makeup to cover up the scar. Silco's natural eye color is green, but later on turns blue in his right eye, and his left eye is orange with a dark sclera. He wears a maroon dress shirt with a black and dark red-purple vest with gold accents, white tie, black pants, and black and maroon steel-toed boots.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 High Intelligence :  Silco is able to lead an entire criminal empire and to stay out of sight of the authorities, thanks to elaborated corruption and tricks, showing that he is capable of great cunning. 
 Leader :  Thanks to his intelligence, ideology and scare tactics, Silco was respected and feared in Zaun. A lot of people, including Sevika, left Vander's side to join him. He was also able to rule on the Lanes and the Chem-barons during the seven-year timeskip. 
 Fighting :  Although he is not physically impressive, Silco has shown in his two duels against Vander that he was able to be fast and vicious. He seems particularly good at handling a knife. 
 Stamina :  Due to his past as a miner, Silco seems quite resistant to pain and is accustomed to the Underground's toxic gasses. Where his subordinates cannot breathe it, he seems almost immune to it. 
 Trivia [ ] 
 After the show's release, it was announced that Silco would be added to  Riot Games '  Teamfight Tactics  as part of the upcoming  Gizmos & Gadgets  mid-set. [11] [12] 
 In the alternate universe, Silco's scars are much better healed, probably because he undergoes less stress, due to the fact that he is not a crime lord in this version.

 Biography [ ] 
 Sometime before  Ekko 's arrival, Silco and  Vander  both mutually forgive each other for their past actions. It is unknown when this even occurred, but presumably after  Vi 's death. 
 Later on, during the Innovators Competition, he accompanies Vander at the bar.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 He seems to have returned to his younger personality, no longer aggressive or cunning. He is kind towards Ekko and Vander; seen when Ekko asks about his previous attempt to kill the other man, he simply responds with how strong forgiveness can be.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Silco looks the same as his main universe counterpart, but with the noticeable difference of a dull grey eye on his left side compared to the dark and orange one from the main universe. He wears a white and gold button-up covered by a red and white sweater vest with brown leather shoulder pads.
 
 Trivia [ ] 
 Silco's damaged eye is much farther healed in this universe, perhaps due to not being consistently injected with Shimmer 
 Silco is much better friends with Vander showing the power of forgiveness 
 His eye also does not look infected/purple as it does in our storyline, but instead is a calm grey

 Biography [ ] 
 Singed , also known as the ""Mad Chemist,"" is a brilliant yet enigmatic scientist in  Arcane . 
 Hailing from  Zaun , he operates on the fringes of morality, pushing the boundaries of science regardless of the consequences. His relentless pursuit of knowledge and innovation defines him as both a genius and a harbinger of destruction.
 Singed plays a critical role in the creation of  Shimmer , the highly potent and addictive substance that grants its users extraordinary strength and resilience. To develop this chemical, Singed experiments extensively, using test subjects ranging from humans to exotic creatures. His fascination with evolution and biology leads him to use a creature named  Rio , a rare animal with regenerative abilities. Singed attempts to harness Rio's biological properties to unlock the secrets of life and transformation, sacrificing the creature's health in the process. This obsession underscores his belief that progress requires great sacrifice—a theme that defines his character.
 In his lab, Singed is shown with a  Two-headed Creature , another experimental subject. This creature symbolizes his disregard for natural boundaries, as he manipulates lifeforms to serve his scientific ambitions. While the exact purpose of this experiment remains unclear, it demonstrates Singed's willingness to tamper with the very fabric of life to achieve his goals.
 Singed's partnership with Silco stems from their shared vision of empowering Zaun, albeit through destructive means. He supplies Silco with Shimmer, which becomes a cornerstone of Silco’s rise to power. However, Singed’s motivations go beyond loyalty; he views his work as a necessary path to greater understanding, even if it brings chaos to Zaun.
 Singed’s character is tinged with tragedy. A photograph in his lab hints at a lost loved one—possibly a  daughter —who might have inspired his obsession with preserving and enhancing life. This loss adds depth to his otherwise cold and calculating demeanor, suggesting that his unyielding drive stems from deeply personal pain.
 In  Arcane , Singed is a figure of shadows and complexity, whose experiments shape the fates of countless lives in Zaun. He is neither wholly villain nor hero, but a man consumed by his vision of progress, willing to destroy in order to create.

 Biography [ ] 
 Little is known of Sky's childhood or adult life. It can be assumed that at some point in her early childhood, she lived in the same area of  Zaun  as Viktor—she can be seen in a flashback to Viktor’s childhood, where she appears with a group of children playing in a stream. [1]  It is unknown how Sky’s crush on Viktor came about, but it’s presumed she had a crush on him since they were young.
 By Acts 2 and 3 of  Season 1 , Sky has become  Jayce  and Viktor’s assistant and can be seen helping Jayce prepare for his Progress Day speech in  Episode Four . While walking past Viktor, Sky clutches her books closer to her chest and avoids Viktor's eye contact, smiling to herself.
 
Sky nervously asks him to walk home with her from the laboratory to further her relationship with Viktor. However, Viktor, obsessing over the Hexcore, remains oblivious to Sky's affection and shortly denies her request. Sky gently chides Viktor for overworking himself, reminding him:  There’s always tomorrow… right?
—Sky Young Well, not for Sky. Soon after this interaction, she decides to attempt talking to Viktor again. She can be heard confessing her admiration for Viktor in a practice speech while walking towards the door of their laboratory. Upon entering the room, she finds Viktor covered in carved runes, with his hand clasped to the glowing, sputtering Hexcore. In a desperate and instinctive act to save his life, Sky rushes over and clings to Viktor, attempting to pull him away from the Hexcore - and being vaporized in the process.
 Once Viktor regains consciousness, he finds little left of Sky besides a teal journal, a jacket, and her half-moon glasses. The Hexcore had used Sky’s life force to sustain Viktor.
 Overcome with guilt, Viktor scatters her ashes over the stream they used to play in as children.
 Sky was reincarnated inside the Hexcore during  Season 2 , and she became Viktor’s assistant once again. Sky was mainly seen by his side supporting his many trials and tribulations while helping the  Shimmer   addicts  in Zaun. After Jayce destroyed Viktor’s physical body, Sky disappeared from the Hexcore. Her current location is unknown. 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 As we rarely saw Sky outside of Viktor's presence, it's difficult to gauge what her countenance might have been. However, while around Viktor, Sky was shy, quiet, and nervous. She had a slouched posture and a tendency to evade eye contact, suggesting a lack of confidence.
 However, through her journal, we learn that Sky was also an incredibly kind, empathetic, and altruistic person. She was deeply inspired by Viktor's desire to help the people of his city, leading her to pursue a career that would ultimately allow her to help as many people as possible.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Sky had light brown skin, eyes, and chestnut brown hair pulled back in a high ponytail. She had freckles across her cheeks and wore half-moon glasses. She wore the Academy colors of a white blazer, a red shirt, cropped navy trousers, and light grey and white shoes. 
 In her Astral Form, Sky’s hair turned white and she no longer needed her glasses. 
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Astral Form : In Sky's astral form, she can travel through the Hexcore and help Viktor use his powers. 
 Trivia [ ] 
 In her Astral Form, Sky does not need her glasses.

 History [ ] 
 At one point, Smeech became part of the group of crime lords that control the undercity led by  Silco . [1] 
 Smeech once had a problem with someone from the Lanes who could not repay his debt to him. Smeech sent him a signed note and a warning not to go to his compatriots and made a joke about the man's amputated leg. He then had his henchman break into the man's warehouse to go through the man's things and presumably steal what was believed by the investigators to be a stash of medical equipment. Because the target confronted his docile but strong lackey, the man was killed, with part of the encounter seen by a witness, and became the subject of a homicide investigation.
 Because Silco had the  Sheriff  in his pocket and because of the witness' fear of repercussion from the  chem-barons , the investigation became an unsolved, cold case. Another enforcer,  Caitlyn Kiramman , found the records of this and kept it as part of an ongoing investigation on  the underground's then unknown ruler  and his  mole  in Piltover. Caitlyn momentarily believed that the ringleader ""S"" was Smeech before one of their interviewees made it clear that he wasn't, discriminating against Smeech for being a  yordle . [2] 
 After the actions of Silco's adoptive daughter  Jinx  caused the closure of the borders to Piltover, the chem-barons' businesses were affected. They called a meeting to discuss their next action, during which  Finn  tried to convince them to stand their ground against Silco and his unwillingness to stop Jinx's antics. Before they could discuss further, Silco arrived and released a toxic gas in the air before giving them gas masks, reminding them of the insufferable past he'd saved them from. [1] 
 At the beginning of Act 2, Smeech and his goons decide to capture Jinx. However, Sevika and  Isha  ambushed him, and the former killed Smeech with her newfound mechanical arm.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Smeech was a very cunning character in the series. During a meet-up, he acted sneaky toward the other chem-barons.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Smeech's first real appearance was in season two, episode two.
 He is a yorkle chem-baron and his limbs are replaced by robotic ones.

 Biography [ ] 
 Steb appears standing guard beside  Maddie  during  Mel's  speech. He'd later escort Mel to safety when  Renni  and her cohorts attacked the area. [1] 
 That night, Steb does an eye examination on  Caitlyn . He later appears beside his Enforcer comrades when Caitlyn announces to the Council members that she plans to launch an objective attack on Zaun. [1] 
 Steb is seen getting blown over when Piltover was overwhelmed by colorful smog. He's later seen in attendance of a joint speech between Salo and Ambessa. [2] 
 Stationed on the bridge with fellow Enforcers, he stands post with floodlights turned on behind them. As the morning comes, the lights go off, and  Gert , alongside fellow Zaunites, walk through without any hassle. [3] 
 During the Noxian invasion, Steb and his group are seen from a distance by Caitlyn. An Enforcer from her group then tosses a gas canister that allows them to use the gas to ambush the Noxian soldiers covertly. When the Enforcer carrying a cylinder meant for Viktor's orb dies, Steb takes it all while losing his gas mask in the process. [4] 
 Despite attaching the bomb to Viktor's orb, a single nail jammed into the cogs, forcing it not to explode. [4] 
 Eventually, Steb is held at gunpoint by Noxian soldiers until  Jinx  and her reinforcements arrive, allowing him and his fellow Enforcers to escape. He's also protected by a barrier created by  Mel  when a bullet would have struck him. [4] 
 A little later, Steb is possessed by one of Viktor's dolls, but is later released from their control. [4] 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Steb is quiet and reserved. He has almost no lines during his time on screen. He shows great bravery, frequently jumping into action when needed or when others are in danger.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Steb appears to be 6'1ft (185cm). He has angular facial features, bright blue eyes, gil-like markings on his jaw and neck, short hair on the back and sides, and longer hair on top. He has green skin with scale-like detail and fin-like ears, a possible nod to Vastayan heritage.
 The scales around his eyes are reactive, occasionally making subtle movements. He can be seen wearing multiple variations of the Piltover enforcer uniform, from ceremonial to tactical.
 
 Powers and Abilities [ ] 
 Steb is a Piltover enforcer and thus has basic weapons training. He shows moderate skill with firearms and hand-to-hand combat. His weapon is the tonfa, which he uses as part of Caitlyn's strike team.
 He also appears to have some medical knowledge and is seen tending to injuries and checking vitals.
 
 Trivia [ ] 
 Steb's one line appears to be a call to action: ""Let's G0!"" during the final episode of season 2

 The Hexcore 
 
 
 
 The  Hexcore  is the true overarching antagonist of Arcane, being the catalyst for much of the death and destruction that occurs throughout the series.

 Hexcore : The Catalyst of Creation and Destruction [ ] 
 The Hexcore is a groundbreaking yet perilous invention in  Arcane , representing the collision of science, magic, and unchecked ambition. Created by  Jayce  and  Viktor , it epitomizes the potential to transcend natural limits while carrying the seeds of its own destruction. The Hexcore’s influence extends beyond mere technology, as it becomes a key driver in shaping the destinies of Piltover and Zaun—for better and for worse.
 
 Creation and Features [ ] 
 The Hexcore was developed in Piltover during Viktor and Jayce’s collaboration to push hextech’s boundaries. By combining hextech crystals with organic materials, the Hexcore became a sentient and adaptive entity, capable of:
 
 Rewriting Biology : It could heal injuries, enhance physical abilities, and transcend mortal limitations. 
 Powering Evolution : The Hexcore evolved alongside its users, responding to their desires but often at a devastating cost. 
 Unpredictable Sentience : Its ability to act autonomously made it powerful but highly dangerous. 
 A Vision of Hope and Ruin [ ] 
 For Viktor, the Hexcore was a beacon of hope. He saw it as a solution to uplift Zaun’s oppressed people, granting them the ability to overcome sickness, poverty, and inequality. For  Jayce , it represented the possibilities of technological innovation but also a growing concern over its instability. The device’s ability to enhance life was quickly overshadowed by its darker tendencies—demanding sacrifices, corrupting its users, and unraveling the balance between science and humanity.
 
 Jayce’s Time Travel Vision [ ] 
 In a pivotal moment, Jayce is granted a vision of the future—a timeline where the Hexcore’s unchecked power leads to catastrophic consequences. He sees a world where the Hexcore, once a symbol of progress, has become a weapon of unparalleled destruction.
 
 Piltover’s Downfall : The Hexcore’s volatile nature causes catastrophic explosions, destroying much of Piltover’s infrastructure and plunging its citizens into chaos. 
 Zaun’s Corruption : While initially benefiting from the Hexcore’s enhancements, Zaun becomes consumed by the substance's toxic influence, turning its people into mutated husks, enslaved by its power. 
 Fractured Societies : The vision highlights how the Hexcore exacerbates the divide between Piltover and Zaun, fueling violence, distrust, and ultimately the collapse of both cities. 
 This haunting vision serves as a warning to Jayce of the potential destruction that unbridled ambition and reckless innovation can bring. It forces him to confront the ethical responsibilities of their creation and question whether the Hexcore should ever exist.
 
 Impact on  Arcane [ ] 
 The Hexcore’s story reflects the central themes of  Arcane : ambition, sacrifice, and the duality of progress. While it offers a glimpse of a brighter future, its unchecked power leads to devastation, as seen in Jayce’s vision. The Hexcore becomes a cautionary tale, embodying the dangers of scientific discovery without ethical boundaries.
 In the end, the Hexcore is both a savior and destroyer—capable of transforming the world but equally capable of tearing it apart. Its legacy shapes the fate of Piltover and Zaun, leaving a mark on the lives of its creators and the world they sought to change."

 Biography [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Awaiting the start of the trial of  Jayce Talis ,  Mel Medarda  gifts Torman a child's town she purchased from a craftsman. However, he scorns the gift that  Salo  tried to give him as he was allergic to nuts. When Council head  Cecil B. Heimerdinger  proposes that Jayce be expelled from the Academy, Torman votes in favor of it. [1] 
 Torman is seen attending a party with his fellow Council members and socialites. [2] 
 The day after the Progress Day celebration,  Jinx  stole the Hextech Crystal ball, which was the subject of a Council Meeting. Torman scorns how the Underground has gone on unchecked. As the meeting continues, Torman fiddles with his toy and lists the possibilities the Underground people could produce using the stolen crystal. Once Jayce proposes that all Hextech operations be shut down, Torman and Shoola disapprove of this decision. He notes the consequences of his shipping trade that'd be affected by this decision. As the meeting continues, Mel proposes that Jayce become a council member and that his house be elevated. Heimerdinger seconds that proposal, and Mel suggests a vote be held. [2] 
 Torman is shown attending a theatrical performance with his fellow councilmen  Salo , who naturally hate each other. Still, their shared passion for spirits conjoins them. [3] 
 A meeting is held concerning Piltover's fractured nature, and despite Heimerdinger's desire to reevaluate and change the Council's immoral ways, Jayce argues differently. He claims that Heimerdinger is a relic of the past. Despite being the founder of Piltover, Heimerdinger was unanimously voted out. [4] 
 During a council meeting about the recent incident on the bridge, Torman details that three of his suppliers will delay shipments until fall to wait until things ""cool down"". As the meeting progresses,  Caitlyn  and  Vi  arrive to cast the blame on Silco.

 When did you get so comfortable living in someone else's shadow?
 
 Vi  to Vander, "" Welcome to the Playground "" 
 Warwick  (born  Vander ) was once the unspoken leader and protector of  the undercity . Determined and zealous, Vander did all he could in his later life to ensure the safety of those under his protection—the residents of Zaun and, more specifically, the four children he'd taken under his wing. When a series of events forces him to choose between an established truce between Zaun and  Piltover  and his children, Vander's life is turned on its head by his past.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 In his youth, Vander formed a strong sibling like bond with two other  Zaun ite individuals,  Silco  and  Felicia , with him and Silco sharing dreams of Zaun's freedom and unity as one nation. At one point, however, the two had a falling out, after which Vander tried to drown Silco in a river, only for the latter to slice his arm to escape. [2] 
 Vander would come to earn the nickname ""Hound of the Underground"", who fought for the community he'd supposedly built and united. He tried to lead a revolt across the bridge to Piltover, one that ended in failure and resulted in multiple deaths, including those of  Felicia and Connol [3]  Upon seeing their bodies, Vander dropped his gauntlets, symbolically abandoning his fight against Piltover, [2]  and took their children  Vi  and  Powder  in. Eventually, he also came to adopt two other children:  Mylo  and  Claggor , all of whom grew up eager to please and to prove themselves to Vander and those around them. [4] 
 In hopes of establishing some semblance of peace in Zaun for their protection, Vander struck a deal with the  Enforcers , mainly their Sheriff,  Grayson —he would ensure that Zaunites would not cause trouble in the upper city, and the enforcers will stay out of his business. [4]  This news would somehow reach Silco, who despised this decision. [2] 
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 One day, his children decided to go topside to try to pull off a heist on their own. The attempt caught the attention of the  Council  and the authorities because it caused an explosion in the Academy district, and the workshop they'd broken into belonged to an  influential family . Even Vander's connection to the  Enforcers  and the leniency of  Sheriff Grayson  could not protect them, though Grayson at least asked for one culprit to take responsibility so that they could present a culprit to the Council. [4] 
 Vander had to talk the children down, particularly Vi, from making more of a scene. This proved challenging due to the continued pressure on the enforcers from the Council and the children's tendency for trouble. After a conversation with Vi, during which he reminded her of the risks fighting Piltover posed, [3]  Vi stole the pneumatic tube capsule from Vander and sent a message to Grayson so she could surrender herself to spare the others. Vander caught on, stopped, and trapped Vi in  Benzo 's basement while he turned himself in instead.
 Before he could be taken to the upper city, they were intercepted by Silco and a  beast on Shimmer  who, after killing Grayson and Benzo, dragged Vander to Silco’s  Shimmer  factory. Silco finally confronted him for their last encounter before he strapped Vander to a chair in preparation for an experiment for  Singed . Vi, Claggor, and Mylo then arrived to break him out. Moments away from escaping, multiple explosions caused by  Powder  rock the cannery, and Vander fights back against Silco's remaining men and the beast before getting stabbed by Silco. Desperate to protect Vi, Vander used the last of his strength to take Shimmer, temporarily turning himself into a monstrous beast. Vander then grabbed Vi and jumped out of the collapsing building, apparently dying from the fall. [2] 
 However, as revealed in episode 9, Singed found Vander's body and took it back to his lab, where he began experimenting on him.
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Vander, now Warwick, has been transformed into a wolf-like beast by Singed. Vander retains little of his humanity as he becomes instinctual, bloodthirsty, and animalistic. He is then released and rampages the prison that Jinx and Sevika are inside, freeing Zaunite prisoners that were arrested unlawfully; one of these prisoners being Isha. Warwick continues the spree, killing any guard and prisoner in his way until finally getting to Jinx, Sevika, Isha, and the Enforcers who were preparing to arrest them. The Enforcers turn their focus to Warwick, attempting and failing to stop him as Jinx haphazardly prepares her weapons. Jinx would tell Sevika to run and get Isha away as she prepares the fight the beast head on. 
 Jinx ends up getting pinned to the wall, Warwick ready to tear her apart until pausing. Flashes of Powder begin to cloud his eyes as he stares at Jinx, remembering the scared little girl he took in as his own daughter. This seemed to calm the beast, as Warwick’s breathing steadied, presumably allowing Jinx to slip away.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Vander is implied to have been a brutal man in his younger years. A flashback reveals an incident between him and Silco, where Vander tried to viciously drown the latter in Zaun’s polluted river, despite carrying a knife with him. After leading a failed uprising against Piltover's regime that saw a tragic loss of life, Vander was forced to bear the message to Vi and Powder that their parents had lost their lives in the fighting. After witnessing the grief this bore upon the two children, Vander turned pacifist, dropping his weapons and carrying the girls away to raise them as their father.
 At the time of Arcane's first act, Vander was the surrogate father of Vi, Powder, Mylo, and Claggor. A caring man, Vander was always willing to protect those who needed his help. He was seen as a protector by many, and he cared for the Lanes and the people in them. He governed the Lanes through paternal authority, relying on people's gratitude and genuine respect for him to maintain order. Even though he had turned pacifist, he defied his dogma in Episode 3, fighting and seemingly dying to save Vi's life.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Vander was a large, muscular middle-aged man with grey eyes, dark hair, and a neatly trimmed, graying beard. He was generally seen wearing blue trousers, leather boots, a brown leather jacket over a white undershirt, and a leather pauldron on his upper right arm to cover up the scar he got from Silco when he was younger. 
 When Vander uses Shimmer as a last resort to save Vi, it dramatically increases his muscle mass, makes him grow several feet in height, and makes his veins purple and pop out all over his body. The drug also makes him lose some of his cognitive abilities, as he was seen acting more animalistic while under the effects of Shimmer. 
 In his transformed state as Warwick, he has an unnaturally muscular and enlarged body with dark grey fur coating his back, head, and arms. He has metal fans and bolts scattered across body, as well as a central pump filled with a green liquid on his back. His hands are metal gauntlets with sharp claws as fingers. Vander’s face has wolf-like features with pointy ears, wolf nose, and a smaller muzzle-like mouth with sharp teeth. He has dark grey hair and a beard which connects to the fur on his back. In this form; his sclera is black, his right iris is blue, and his left iris is yellowish-green.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Brawler:  Vander had a gift for hand-to-hand combat and was shown to dominate most fights he ever got involved in, even against Shimmer-enhanced opponents. He also taught Vi how to punch, a notable feat considering how skilled Vi became at boxing in her teenage years. 
 Barkeep:  As the owner of The Last Drop, Vander was a skilled bartender and could make various kinds of drinks. 
 Leader:  Vander was a competent and honorable leader despite his past failings, and many Zaunites respected him for it, even after he supposedly died. 
 Teacher:  As the adoptive father of four children, Vander would be their primary teacher in life and gave them just about every skill they needed to survive in Zaun. Even after his assumed death, his lessons would still resonate with Vi and Powder, as displayed when Vi had a hallucination of him encouraging her to work on her guard and get back up during her second fight with Sevika. 
 Trivia [ ] 
 Vander was widely theorized to be the  League of Legends  champion  Warwick , [5] [6]  which was confirmed in the  final episode  of  season 1 . Further shown in  Arcane: Season 2 First Look . 
 Vander and  Loris  have similar appearances, and Vi mistook Loris for Vander in the series finale.

 Season 1 [ ] 
 Sitting in a dimly lit corner beside his associate,  Jules ;  Vern  pays  Huck , who brings a couple of mugs of beer to the table. After Huck inspects the bag's contents, he notes that the amount isn't the ten thousand of what they agreed upon; however, Verne claims that is the price for business. Growing upset, Huck lasses out about not being paid the promised amount, and Jules gives him two choices.
 Just then,  Vander  arrives and asks if they need any help, and Vern promptly asks that he leave them. However, Vander refuses, and after taking a seat at the table as the bar patrons look at the two in scorn, Vern calls Vander by his name and Jules by his title. Vander would then politely force the two to honor their deal with Huck, with whom they tacitly agree.
 After seeing the arrival of  Vi  and her companions enter the bar, Vander takes his leave.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 Violet was born in  Zaun  to  Felicia  and  Connol , later having a younger sister, Powder, who she was very close to. When  Vander  led a rebellion against Piltover, her parents were killed in battle, and Vander took the sisters in. Vander later adopted two orphan boys as well, and Vi became the leader of their group.
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Act 1 
 Vi led her siblings ( Powder ,  Mylo  and  Claggor )  topside  for a job. They use the roofs of Piltover to climb to the house where there are supposed to be valuables. They easily break in, but the workshop blows up when Powder accidentally drops an unstable  crystal . Before they get  underground , they are stopped by  Deckard , who asks them if they have a good loot. Mylo answers in the affirmative, and a fight breaks out; Powder is given the bag with valuables and, at some point, runs away. They emerge victorious, but Powder throws the valuables they stole into the water by accident.
 Defeated, they return  home , where Vander awaits them. Vi initially tries to deny she and the others have anything to do with the explosion on topside, but the truth comes out fast. Vander leaves to deal with the aftermath of their actions. Mylo blames Powder for losing their loot, but Vi is quick to stop him. Later, she takes Powder with her outside and talks to her about her and the boys' failures to show her sister that no one is infallible.
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Vi begins the season in a state of despair and isolation, taking up pitfighting in Zaun as a way to channel her pain. This phase reflects her internal struggle as she copes with the fallout from Season 1, particularly her fractured relationship with Jinx.
 Her relationship with Jinx takes center stage once again as the sisters are forced to confront their shared trauma and their diverging paths. When Warwick (revealed to be Vander) is unleashed upon the city, Vi and Jinx team up to face him. This reunion highlights their enduring bond despite their differences. In a deciding moment during the  final battle  at the Hexgates, Jinx sacrifices herself to save Vi from Warwick, detonating a grenade that causes the tower to explode. Jinx’s fate remains uncertain, leaving Vi grappling with grief and hope.
 Vi’s relationship with Caitlyn also evolves significantly throughout the season. Initially strained by misunderstandings and betrayals, they reconcile by the series’ end. In a poignant final scene, they are shown together in an ornate house, symbolizing a hopeful new chapter for both characters.
 As Piltover and Zaun rebuild after the battles, Vi reflects on the losses she has endured while holding onto hope for the future. 
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Vi is a sassy and direct person. She is hot-headed and gets criticized for her impatience, as she can become reckless when angered. She is shown to be guilt-ridden over leaving Powder and what has happened to her adoptive family, which leads to her distancing herself when she fears loved ones could get in harm's way yet again. While she was in prison, she seemed to have gotten more of an edge and started to build walls around herself, never showing anyone vulnerability unless they had earned her trust.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Vi is a young woman of average height and muscular build. She has pink hair, with one side of her head shaved and the hair on the other side long and messy. She has a tattoo that spells ""VI"" under her left eye and another big tattoo across her spine area up to her neck and her arms. Her ears and left nostril are pierced, and she has scars on her left eyebrow and one on her upper lip. Her eyes are a silvery, powder blue with darker blue flecks, and she later dyes most of her hair black, with barely any pink parts left. After being abandoned by Caitlyn she often has dark vertical streaks under her eyes while fighting.
 
 Abilities [ ] 
 Hand-to-hand combat:  Vi is a skilled brawler, having been taught by Vander since her youth. 
 Parkour:  Vi is extremely athletic, having no difficulties scaling rooftops and returning to Zaun from Piltover through an unconventional method by jumping off a cliff to running across a steel beam. 
 Trivia [ ] 
 When Jinx starts betting on her in the pit fighting ring, VI starts losing the fights.

 Biography [ ] 
 Death [ ] 
 Her life is presumably the same as in the main universe (from what we see) up until her death in  Jayce 's laboratory. When the  Hextech  gemstones explode she is killed in the accident, leaving  Powder ,  Mylo , and  Claggor  to grieve for her in the remains of the explosion. 
 
 Legacy [ ] 
 Because of her death, a strand of unknown events happen that causes  Vander  to forgive  Silco  and vice versa; Vander,  Benzo , Mylo, and Claggor do not die, and  Zaun  becomes an independent nation. Powder keeps a small altar for Vi in her home that has a painting of her, a doll with a music box, incense sticks, and a drawer with hidden hextech gemstones.

 Biography [ ] 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 Viktor was born in the  Undercity , where the less than ideal environment attributed to his malformed leg. Later on, in his teenage years, he was found by  Heimerdinger , who offered Viktor the position of his assistant in  Piltover . 
 As a child, Viktor was left out due to his disability. Born with a malformed leg and needing a cane to walk, his mobility issues inhibited him from playing with other children. Despite his loneliness, he was incredibly intelligent. He fostered an engineering talent, even creating a working model steamboat he completes and tests within a flashback at the start of  Episode Six . In this episode, he meets  Sky  for the first time as a child, watching him as he toyed with the boat.
 After placing the boat in a stream to test-run it, the current of the water pulls it downstream faster than he can keep up with. Demonstrating recklessness even as a child, Viktor chooses to follow the stream down into a dark, cave-like room - where he finds it in the hands of  Singed , a scientist who is attempting to preserve the life of a mutated  Waverider  named  Rio .
 Praising Viktor for the quality of his invention, Singed allows Viktor to assist him in caring for Rio, feeding her what appears to be an early, raw variant of  Shimmer . 
 After finding Rio in contorted in pain and hooked up to a series of machines, Viktor is horrified. Singed claims, ""The mutation must survive,"" - but Viktor is unaccepting of his ethos and runs away.
 How  Heimerdinger  discovers Viktor is unclear. Still, somewhere in his late teens, Heimerdinger encounters him and takes him under his wing, allowing him to study at the University of Piltover. Viktor goes on to become his assistant as Dean of the Academy.
 
While investigating on Heimerdinger's behalf, Viktor first meets  Jayce Talis , a fellow scientist whose illegal research is interrupted and exposed by  a robbery . Viktor risks stealing Jayce's notebook from Heimerdinger's office and seeks Jayce out to discuss its contents with him. After successfully talking a suicidal Talis off the edge of his destroyed apartment, Viktor reassures Jayce that hope is not lost. ""If you're going to change the world, don't ask for permission."" - Viktor Jayce and Viktor begin working in what is presumably Viktor's office, discovering that the gemstones Jayce acquired can only operate under a much higher frequency. Jayce expresses a desire to explain his discovery to the council, to which Viktor retaliates they have an absence of proof. After realizing his equipment will be destroyed the following day, Jayce is devastated - leading Viktor to suggest breaking into Heimerdinger's lab to retrieve it.
 Once they arrive at the lab, Viktor and Jayce are caught by  Mel Medarda , who, after being convinced by Jayce's speech, allows them one night to prove they are risk-worthy by allowing them to stay, while she distracts a security guard.
 Years later,  Hextech  blows up in popularity. Viktor lives in the shadow of Jayce, who is getting far more credit for their invention of  Hextech . Viktor had made a new creation called the  Hexcore , which he vernerbly studies. One night as he studies the Hexcore, Viktor looks sickly and collapses at his desk. It is revealed that he is terminally ill, and his diagnosis only spurs his drive to continue in his research, dedicating himself to discovering the workings of the arcane.
 Heimerdinger visits him in the fissures, and Viktor tells the  yordle  how his contributions would fade away soon after his death. 
 In a bid to prolong his longevity, he seeks out the  doctor , who gives him a vial of a  shimmer  variant, which he takes in conjunction with exposure to  The Hexcore . His bad leg is healed, and he is able to walk for the first time. 
 Spurred on by  Mel Medarda's  influence, Jayce considers using their technology to create weapons to defend Piltover, to which Viktor is violently opposed.
 Later on Viktor reaches out to the Hexcore, which begins glowing and flashing wildly. Sky walks in, and tries to save him but is vaporized by the core, filling Viktor with guilt.
 
He visits his childhood area in  Zaun  to scatter Sky's ashes in the river where he first met her. He hesitantly attempts to walk off the ledge to kill himself, but Jayce appears behind him. They talk, and reminisce about the time they spent together at the Distinguished Innovators Competition.  Viktor asks Jayce to destroy the Hexcore in which he hesitates, but eventually agrees.
 Viktor joins Jayce at the council where he announces Jayce's deal with Silco in making Zaun an independent nation, when  Jinx 's rocket hits the council building and kills Viktor.
 
 Season 2 [ ] 
 Viktor is rushed to his and Jayce's lab by the other man to try and save him. Jayce grabs the Hexcore, and fuses it with Viktor's body. This locks Viktor in a magical cocoon that transforms his entire body into an  arcane -altered form. When Viktor awakes, he breaks out of the cocoon and wakes up a sleeping Jayce. Jayce hugs and grabs him a blanket, when the two get into an argument about the Hexcore now inside Viktor and how Jayce had revived him. Viktor leaves, saying their paths had diverged long ago.
 Viktor goes to Zaun where he sees all of the suffering when he sees a vision of Sky leading him to a specific area. Some Shimmer addicts including  Huck  follow him, when Viktor places his hand on the mans forehead in a spectacle of purple light, and cures Huck of all his Shimmer ailments and reverts him to a younger, healthier body. 
 Viktor begins to heal any and all the people willing with the help of Sky's vision, and steadily builds a  commune  full of the cured people.
 Later, Viktor uses  Salo 's body, one of which he cured from a Shimmer addiction and paralyzation, to go to the  Hexgates  and take some of the modules in the heart of the structure. Viktor talks to a transformed Jayce where he offers to talk in person. Jayce ends up murdering Salo.
 Viktor meets with  Vi , Jinx,  Isha , and  Vander  to try and cure the transfigured man. He uses his powers to explore Vander's mind with Sky, where he eventually uncovers the mans memories. 
 Singed shows up to the commune, where the two talk about Vander's state and body. They disagree, and Singed leaves to return to the  Noxian  army.
 Later, Jayce kills him with a blast from his transformed  Mercury Hammer .
 Stuck in another cocoon, he relies on the blood Singed gives him to live. He talks with  Ambessa Medarda , and agrees to transform any soldier she gives him in return for her help escorting him to the Hexgates. He uses one of his followers to enter the council building, where he attempts to persuade Jayce into becoming partners once again. Jayce rejects him, and Viktor begins to fight him and Mel. He looses, causing him to allow Singed to transform him and his followers.
 He says goodbye to Sky, claiming he would miss their talks. Sky fades away, and Viktor begins to transform into the Machine Herald. His body elongates and transforms unnaturally, he grows a ""third arm"" on his back with three claws, and his face splits in two with a mask growing in the middle. He transforms the rest of his followers, along with Vander.
 He travels and arrives with the Noxian army to Piltover, where he is transported in the cocoon. He leaves the cocoon sometime in the battle, and meets Jayce in the heart of the Hexgates. He uses a spell with his third arm to place all of the compartments of the heart back, and begins to fight Jayce as he travels to the top of the tower. Once there, he brings Jayce to the comic realm along with everyone else in the battlefield. Viktor begins the process of Glorious Evolution.  Ekko  comes up to the two on his hoverboard, and throws a  wild rune  at the two. 
 Jayce, freed from the mind control, begins to tell Viktor about how all he wanted was his partner back. Viktor shrinks down in the cosmic realm, and the two hug. Viktor sees the barren future Jayce had been sent to and what would come from his actions, along with seeing his alternate self give Jayce the rune that had started it all. Viktor tells Jayce to leave, but Jayce joins Viktor in destroying the rune.
 The two are absorbed into the rune, and dissipate.
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Viktor is a driven and innovative scientist with an altruistic passion. Due to his disability, Viktor's childhood was spent isolated and separate from other children. This led to strong introversion in his personality - as well as a relative lack of understanding of social cues - when discussing Jayce's notes on  Hextech  with the previously suicidal  Jayce Talis .
 Throughout Season One, Viktor becomes increasingly ambitious in his endeavors - from stealing Jayce's notes to breaking into a lab to experimenting on himself. There is also a hint of narcissism in this side of his personality - he speaks dejectedly to  Professor Heimerdinger  of a failure in securing his ""legacy"". He confesses he fears that his contributions will be ""short-lived"".
 However, in Act 2, his actions mainly revolve around Jayce's actions.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 Viktor is a white man of average height with pale skin, moles, brown hair, and striking amber eyes. In Act I, he can be seen in the  University of Piltover 's uniform of a long-sleeved burgundy shirt with golden buttons, a white waistcoat with dark grey lining, and diamond-shaped white buttons. He also sports a white tie tied in an Atlantic knot (unlike Jayce's red tie - from this, we can presume that ties are indicative of status at the University, as Jayce is a student and Viktor is the Dean's assistant), as well as dark grey trousers and shoes. While he is shown to use a wooden cane, he is without it in certain scenes, suggesting he does not completely rely on it to walk yet.
 By Acts Two and Three of Season One, Viktor's physical stature strongly reflects his health. His hair is longer and less well-kept, he has more prominent and shadowy eyebrows, and his skin is so pale that it almost takes on a blue tinge in some lighting. Due to a significant loss of weight, his clothes appear more crumpled, swapping his burgundy shirt for a brown pinstripe one often rolled up to the elbows, an off-white and grey waistcoat with longer tails and an angular pattern across the front. He also now uses a crutch instead of a cane, impeding his gait and giving him a hunched posture.
 In  Season Two  when Viktor emerges from the Hexcore cocoon, his body is transformed into a machine-like form. His eyes transform in between an array of colors as well. Just like his leg and hand from Season One, his skin is now a stringy purple metal-like texture. Purple glows from underneath this skin, which fades into Viktor’s natural skin color at his cheeks. Gold metal is strewn throughout his skin, mostly on his torso, neck, joints, and arms. He wears the blanket Jayce gives him as a cloak, which becomes his main outfit in Act 1 along with his cane which has an arcane-infected texture.
 In Act Two, Viktor now has longer hair with blonde tipped strands by his ears. The cloak he wore in earlier episodes is now wrapped around his body and strapped together with white belts and golden adornments. His cane is now more similar to a staff, with the handle curving into a more circular shape with golden accents.
 Transformed into the Machine Herald, Viktor’s face is split in two to make room for the geometrical ”mask” in the middle of his face. The eyes on the mask are glowing orange, and the tips of the mask are gold; along with multiple other gold accents across his body such as the ones on his wrists, shoulders, back, and feet. In this form he is much taller and lankier, with his torso being somewhat separated from his legs at the hips with large indents in between the two parts. Viktor has a third arm coming out from his back with a three fingered “claw” at the end. Each of the fingers is tipped in gold with the middle of the claw being a purple glowing circle. This claw is used for arcane magic. Viktor’s cane is now completely transformed into a staff, with the top of the staff being used to hold the  wild rune . His cloak is also tied around his neck, with the cloth underside being red.

 Biography [ ] 
 Early life [ ] 
 Refer to  Viktor .
 
 Season 1 [ ] 
 In season 1, the Mysterious Mage is seen in  Episode 2  where he rescues a young Jayce and his mother. He is seen to give Jayce a crystal which Jayce carries with him into adulthood, it being a representation of his dream to create  Hextech .
 Jayce is seen to have held this original meeting with the Mysterious Mage as a significant factor in his motive to utilise the  Arcane  via scientific means and to feel strongly about the experience to the extent of defying  Heimerdinger  when requested to abandon the research for fears of corruption.
 
 Season II [ ] 
 In season 2, it is revealed in  Episode 9  that the identity of the Mysterious Mage is that of Viktor, having gone through parallel universes to give Jayce the crystal. It is shown in these universes that the appearance of the crystal changes in each iteration, implying a possible differing outcome to each. The timeline followed by the show is implied to be the timeline where Jayce succeeds in preventing Viktor's observed outcome of the Glorious Evolution and its consequences, thus fulfilling a promise he made to him in the alternate timeline seen in  Episode 7 .
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Contrary to how Viktor is seen in Act III, the Mysterious Mage is seen to be saddened by the outcome of his intertwinement with the  Hexcore  and the  Arcane . He appears relieved to see Jayce and has a desire to prevent the outcome of the Glorious Evolution his past self was devoted to.
 
 Appearance [ ] 
 The Mysterious Mage appears as an older, bearded Viktor. He wears a hooded robe and carries a staff. His hair appears longer, and his eyes shift in color as his earlier self's does, indicating a connection remains between him and the Arcane. In addition, the metallic-like effect on the sides of his face remains, although, he distinctly lacks the changes in his body seen at the beginning of season 2 caused by being encased by the Hexcore.
 
 Powers and Abilities [ ] 
 Control of the Arcane : Viktor can utilize the arcane, seen when he teleports a young Jayce and his mother to another location, and when he sends Jayce back to  The Main Universe . 
 Trivia [ ] 
 The butterfly often seen in relation to Viktor is shown in  Episode 2,   foreshadowing the reveal. 
 Viktor appears to have repeated the act of giving Jayce the crystal in seemingly all timelines, as implied in  the series finale 's dialogue.

 Biography [ ] 
 Ximena first appears in Jayce's flashback in  episode 2 , where she collapses and nearly dies from presumably hypothermia, and was frostbitten as shown by a close up of her blackened fingers. She and Jayce are saved by a mysterious figure using magic, something she does not want Jayce to continue pursuing. When she appears later on, she is shown to lost some of her fingers in this incident, having gold prosthetic fingers.
 She is a member of House Talis, a toolmaking House known for their invention of the collapsible pocket wrench. Her voice holds some weight in the  Piltover Council  during Jayce's trial, when she backs up  Heimerdinger  and  Cassandra Kiramman's  vote for Jayce not to be exiled. She claims he is not of his right mind and that his dreams of research are impossible. She later tells him she said what she had to in order to keep him safe, indicating she would support his dreams if they were safer.
 In  episode 4 , she can be seen among the crowds on Progress Day. In  episode 7 , she comforts Jayce as he decides whether or not to take violence against  Zaun .
 
 Characteristics [ ] 
 Personality [ ] 
 Ximena is a gentle and caring mother. When her and her son were trapped in the blizzard, she sacrificed her warmth to try and keep her son safe. Later on in the season she steps up during Jayce's trial to save him from being banished. When Jayce gets mad at her for this, she sympathizes with him for his dream of magic, but tries to set his expectations to be more realistic. 
 
 Appearances [ ] 
 Ximena is a tan skinned woman with sharp cheekbones and nose, thick eyebrows, and brown (later grey) hair pulled back into a bun with a white streak. She has a mole on her right cheek, along with dark brown eyes, dull purple lipstick, and pearl earrings. Since the frostbite killed her left pointer and middle finger, she wears a black and gold prosthesis (or coverings) on them. Ximena wears a green shirt with puffed shoulders under a maroon and black vest with gold embellishments. 
 Later in Season 1, she wears a white, gold, black, and navy version of this outfit.
 In Season 2 while shes in mourning for her son, she wears a black version of this outfit.
